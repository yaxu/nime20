    abstract = {a perceived periodic pulse that structures the perception of musical rhythm and which serves as a framework for synchronized movement to music. What are the neural mechanisms of musical beat perception, and how did they evolve? One view, which dates back to Darwin and implicitly informs some current models of beat perception, is that the relevant neural mechanisms are relatively general and are widespread among animal species. On the basis of recent neural and cross-species data on musical beat processing, this paper argues for a different view. Here we argue that beat perception is a complex brain function involving temporally-precise communication between auditory regions and motor planning regions of the cortex (even in the absence of overt movement). More specifically, we propose that simulation of periodic movement in motor planning regions provides a neural signal that helps the auditory system predict the timing of upcoming beats. This "action simulation for auditory prediction" ({ASAP}) hypothesis leads to testable predictions. We further suggest that {ASAP} relies on dorsal auditory pathway connections between auditory regions and motor planning regions via the parietal cortex, and suggest that these connections may be stronger in humans than in non-human primates due to the evolution of vocal learning in our lineage. This suggestion motivates cross-species research to determine which species are capable of human-like beat perception, i.e., beat perception that involves accurate temporal prediction of beat times across a fairly broad range of tempi.},

@article{Radcliffe12,
    abstract = {This chapter examines a performance devised and developed collaboratively by the authors between 2007 -11 which uses a repetitious, machine-inspired nineteenth-century dance to control a digital arts piece, exploring the performative interface between human machine workers and technology. The performance was awarded a Quake contemporary dance festival award in 2008. The dance, the The Machinery, traceable to the1820s, is striking as possibly the earliest example of the creative expression of alienation and dehumanization in the industrial workspace. Nineteenth-century cotton mill workers surrendered to the pace of the machine through necessity; in The Machinery, workers find a means of expression by coalescing with the machine, rather than escaping it, reflecting De Certeau's theories of ?the everyday?. A means of addressing boredom and repetition, the predominantly female workers responded performatively to the otherwise potentially overpowering and isolating noises and actions of ?the uniform and unceasing motion of the automaton? (Marx). The dance can be viewed as a way of maintaining the body's control, interaction and creativity, rather than allowing the body to become solely an extension of the capitalist means of production. Paralleling the working conditions of the nineteenth-century textile workers with those of today's computer operators, Radcliffe and Angliss created a mixed media performance piece inspired by women's interaction with technology. Taking the steps of the early nineteenth-century clog dance, they re-contextualised its history, using it to control a machine of the twenty-first century, the digital computer. Thus, the performers - dancer and computer operator - work together to create an intermedial space where the real world, occupied by the human worker, and virtual world of the machine are coupled to each other and acting in equal partnership. The extreme, machine-like control, virtuosity and physical endurance of the dance reflect the stamina required to survive repetitive labour in both the industrial and the post-industrial workplace.},

We argue that the well known challenges of drawing design implications from ethnographic research have led to useful strategies for tightly coupling ethnography and design. We also offer some thoughts on recent controversies over what constitutes useful and proper ethnographic research in the context of {CSCW}. Finally, we argue that as the temporal and spatial horizons of inquiry have expanded, along with new domains of collaborative activity, ethnography continues to provide invaluable perspectives.},

Inspired by the idea of participatory culture, the ensemble has been made open to a diverse and ever changing roster of participants, and may be likened to a human laboratory exploring this question: How is live coding scalable onto larger groups of people coming from diverse backgrounds? This article presents the practices that have developed during the first three years of the Cybernetic Orchestra's existence, starting with a summary of our human organization and physical infrastructure. The {EspGrid} software, developed for enhanced network synchronization and sharing, is reviewed before a final section presents the live coding practices that have crystallized around this specific collective of people, equipment, and code.},

Using a general purpose programming language has advantages over that of a domain-specific language. However, a barrier for a musician wanting to use a general purpose language for computer music has been the lack of high-level music-specific abstractions designed for realtime manipulation, such as those for time. A library for Haskell was developed to give computer musicians a high-level interface for a heterogenous output enviroment.},

This paper proposes five attributes of a live algorithm: adaptability, empowerment, intimacy, opacity and unimagined music. These attributes are explored in {NN} Music, a performer-machine system for {Max/MSP} that fosters listening and learning. Live improvisation is encoded statistically to train a feed-forward neural network, mapped to stochastic processes for musical output. Through adaptation, mappings are learnt and covertly assigned, to be revisited by both player and machine as a performance develops.},

It starts with a discussion of the paradigm of 'interaction' in existing computer music and live electronics approaches, and develops following bio-cybernetic principles such as 'system/ambience coupling', 'noise', and 'self-organisation'. Central to the paper is an understanding of 'interaction' as a network of interdependencies among system components, and as a means for dynamical behaviour to emerge upon the contact of an autonomous system (e.g. a {DSP} unit) with the external environment (room or else hosting the performance). The author describes the design philosophy in his current work with the {AESI} (whose {DSP} component was implemented as a signal patch in {KYMA5}.2), touching on compositional implications (not only live electronics situations, but also sound installations).},

    abstract = {Contemporary discussions of art and technology continue to work on the assumption that making entails the imposition of form upon the material world, by an agent with a design in mind. Against this hylomorphic model of creation, I argue that the forms of things arise within fields of force and flows of material. It is by intervening in these force-fields and following the lines of flow that practitioners make things. In this view, making is a practice of weaving, in which practitioners bind their own pathways or lines of becoming into the texture of material flows comprising the lifeworld. Rather than reading creativity 'backwards', from a finished object to an initial intention in the mind of an agent, this entails reading it forwards, in an ongoing generative movement that is at once itinerant, improvisatory and rhythmic. To illustrate what this means in practice, I compare carpentry and drawing. In both cases, making is a matter of finding the grain of the world's becoming and following its course. Historically, it was the turn from drawing lines to pulling them straight, between predetermined points, which marked the transition from the textilic to the architectonic, debasing the former as craft while elevating the latter as technology.},

Creating a weaving pattern, especially hand weaving for interlacing yarns is a cumbersome task in the textile industry. In this paper, we propose two kinds of playing for creating weaving patterns on multi-input devices: the tie-up plan and the lift plan. Discrete notes on the treble staff are translated into signatures of treadling sequences and discrete notes in the bass staff are translated into signatures of theadling sequences. Artists can use their right hand to compose a treadling sequence for weft yarns and their left hand to play a threading sequence for warp yarns. The treadling and threading sequences become the notes on the full gamut of shafts and treadles. Our result shows that we are able to compose a family of weaving patterns in a similar way to playing the piano in a short time.},

Instead, the intelligent system is decomposed into independent and parallel activity producers which all interface directly to the world through perception and action, rather than interface to each other particularly much.

The paper then considers the different levels of interpretation, which are possible with {IPA} and discusses the notion of when an interpretation is ?good enough?. It goes on to consider issues around the types of topics for which {IPA} is suitable and the emerging pattern of work using the approach. The next section considers how {IPA} studies can widen the type of participants included and also examines the suitability of different data collection methods.

This can therefore provide the industry with a solid foundation of the necessary support staff, capable of providing services to the local community supporting such educational initiatives. This initiative can then release the more conventionally educated to work at the cutting edge of industry. As a driver for wealth generation in India, the IT industry is remarkable. It demands a wide spectrum of intellectual capital.

These include a virtual musical instrument interface, exploring video-based tracking technology to provide an intuitive and nonintrusive musical interface, and sensor-based augmented instrument designs. The paper also describes a distributed multimedia-mapping server which allows multiplatform and multisensory integrations and presents a sample application which integrates a real-time face tracking system.

Despite the impact and ubiquity of {SCAM} principles and techniques in software engineering, there are still frontiers to be explored. Looking "inward" to existing techniques, one finds frontiers of performance, efficiency, accuracy, and usability, looking "outward" one finds new languages, new problems, and thus new approaches. This paper presents a reflective framework for characterizing source languages and domains. It draws on current research projects in music program analysis, musical score processing, and machine knitting to identify new frontiers for {SCAM}. The paper also identifies opportunities for {SCAM} to inspire, and be inspired by, problems and techniques in other domains.},

@article{Parry11,
    abstract = {Animation is a significant form in children's lives. Animated films and television programs make up a substantial part of their experience of narratives and as such are an important resource in their talk and play. Making space in schools for this aspect of children's repertoires of narrative, even in the context of animated film production, can be challenging. In this article I explore some of the barriers to incorporating children's experiences of animation and then offer an account of an activity in which six fifth-year children were encouraged to draw on their popular culture experiences of animation in their text productions. These data demonstrate the way the children were able to create meaning using the affordances of all the modes of animation, revealing their implicit understandings of narrative conventions. The data raise questions regarding what constitutes good and acceptable storytelling in animated films in school and how to accommodate collaborative, hybrid, and transgressive texts and text production in the primary classroom. Finally, I examine the way in which the currency of popular culture affects the hierarchy of learners and the necessity of finding new ways to enable children to share their funds of knowledge about animation in the classroom.},

This key benefit is difficult to directly observe and measure, so evaluating such tools has been problematic. This paper describes an investigation into the application of distributed cognition theories to analyzing and observing cognitive support. Theories of cognitive support are used to generate an analysis of potential cognitive benefits provided by the compilation-error tracking facilities of a commercial software development environment. This analysis is used to generate a scheme for coding user observations such that cognitive support related activity can be tracked. Experiences in applying the technique on data from a field study are reported. The study also serves to provide a glimpse into the ways that programmers and tools cooperate. Implications are drawn for future practices of tool evaluation and engineering.},

    abstract = {In this important theoretical treatise, Jean Lave, anthropologist, and Etienne
Wenger, computer scientist, push forward the notion of situated learning--that
learning is fundamentally a social process and not solely in the learner's
head. The authors maintain that learning viewed as situated activity has as
its central defining characteristic a process they call legitimate peripheral
participation. Learners participate in communities of practitioners, moving
toward full participation in the sociocultural practices of a community.
Legitimate peripheral participation provides a way to speak about crucial
relations between newcomers and oldtimers and about their activities,
identities, artifacts, knowledge and practice. The communities discussed in
the book are midwives, tailors, quartermasters, butchers, and recovering
alcoholics, however, the process by which participants in those communities
learn can be generalized to other social groups.},

    abstract = {Since its publication, Lave and Wenger's concept of legitimate peripheral participation ({LPP}) [18] has become an important concept for understanding situated learning. {LPP} states that learning only occurs when students perceive that what's being taught is aligned with their goals (in {LPP} terms, with the students' perceived community of practice). This has implications for our traditional {CS} courses (e.g., are we teaching what the students perceive as being relevant for their future careers?), but even greater implications for courses for {non-CS} majors. When computer science educators are asked to teach {non-CS} majors, we are often placed in the position of teaching in alignment with a community of practice that does not, or does not yet, exist. In that sense, our teaching is inauthentic---not aligned with a community of practice. However, there is the possibility that we can generate a perception of authenticity or alignment. We use the example of two classes at Georgia Tech that seem successful by several measures, yet suffer this inauthenticity. We propose that a useful tool for understanding how these classes work is the Disney Corporation's Imagineering---their process of story-telling in three-dimensions as used in their theme parks. However, in the end, we find that what students actually learn is not necessarily the story that we are telling them, which points toward future research.},

    abstract = {Methodological reviews have been used successfully to identify research trends and improve research practice in a variety of academic fields. Although there have been three methodological reviews of the emerging field of computer science education research, they lacked reliability or generalizability. Therefore, because of the capacity for a methodological review to improve practice in computer science education and because the previous methodological reviews were lacking, a large scale, reliable, and generalizable methodological review of the recent research on computer science education is reported here. Our overall research question, which has nine subquestions, involved the methodological properties of research reported in articles in major computer science education research forums from the years 2000-2005. The purpose of this methodological review is to provide a methodologically rigorous basis on which to make recommendations for the improvement of computer science education research and to promote informed dialogue about its practice.

distinguish {CSE} research from other forms of educational research, outlining its aims and identity as
a research discipline. In examining the state of the art of {CSE} research, we attempt to categorise past
research studies into general themes, reflecting the diverse contributions to {CSE} made over the years.
Further, we critique each category, highlighting possible benefits and limitations. We argue that
there has been a lack of reference to pedagogical theory, underlying most past research studies. This
has resulted in a failure to provide teachers with "pedagogical content knowledge", critical to gaining
useful insights into cognitive and educational issues surrounding learning. We conclude by providing
guidelines for {CSE} research, stressing the need for a stronger connection to the theoretical
frameworks of education-related disciplines such as pedagogy, epistemology, curriculum studies and
psychology.},

To help achieve this goal, we propose VisualScheme, an interactive programming environment that accompanies the architect from the learning phases to the advanced uses and that can be explored in pedagogic, research, and industry settings.

His work spans some sixty years and includes original work on a diverse range of subjects, from dialectical materialism to architecture, urbanism and the experience of everyday life. The Production of Space is his major philosophical work and its translation has been long awaited by scholars in many different fields. The book is a search for reconciliation between mental space (the space of the philosophers) and real space (the physical and social spheres in which we all live). In the course of his exploration, Henri Lefebvre moves from metaphysical and ideological considerations of the meaning of space to its experience in the everyday life of home and city. He seeks, in other words, to bridge the gap between the realms of theory and practice, between the mental and the social, and between philosophy and reality. In doing so, he ranges through art, literature, architecture and economics, and further provides a powerful antidote to the sterile and obfuscatory methods and theories characteristic of much recent continental philosophy. This is a work of great vision and incisiveness. It is also characterized by its author's wit and by anecdote, as well as by a deftness of style that Donald Nicholson-Smith's sensitive translation precisely captures.}},

We have studied many Paleolithic caves in France in which the answer was remarkably positive; stated shortly: the more resonant the location, the more paintings or signs are situated in this location. Here are presented some studies and results in the caves of Isturitz and Oxocelhaya in Pays Basque and in some other caves.

    abstract = {The Critical Engineer considers Engineering to be the most transformative language of our time, shaping the way we move, communicate and think. It is the work of the Critical Engineer to study and exploit this language, exposing its influence.


The Critical Engineer considers any technology depended upon to be both a challenge and a threat. The greater the dependence on a technology the greater the need to study and expose its inner workings, regardless of ownership or legal provision.


The Critical Engineer raises awareness that with each technological advance our techno-political literacy is challenged.


The Critical Engineer deconstructs and incites suspicion of rich user experiences.


The Critical Engineer looks beyond the 'awe of implementation' to determine methods of influence and their specific effects.


The Critical Engineer recognises that each work of engineering engineers its user, proportional to that user's dependency upon it.


The Critical Engineer expands 'machine' to describe interrelationships encompassing devices, bodies, agents, forces and networks.


The Critical Engineer observes the space between the production and consumption of technology. Acting rapidly to changes in this space, the Critical Engineer serves to expose moments of imbalance and deception.


The Critical Engineer looks to the history of art, architecture, activism, philosophy and invention and finds exemplary works of Critical Engineering. Strategies, ideas and agendas from these disciplines will be adopted, re-purposed and deployed.


The Critical Engineer notes that written code expands into social and psychological realms, regulating behaviour between people and the machines they interact with. By understanding this, the Critical Engineer seeks to reconstruct user-constraints and social action through means of digital excavation.


The Critical Engineer considers the exploit to be the most desirable form of exposure.},

It is not in the nature of cyberspace to be unregulable; cyberspace  has no "nature." It only has code-the software and hardware that make cyberspace  what it is. That code can create a place of freedom-as the original  architecture of the Net did-or a place of oppressive control. Under the  influence of commerce, cyberpsace is becoming a highly regulable space, where behavior is much  more tightly controlled than in real space. But that's not inevitable  either. We can-we must-choose what kind of cyberspace we want and what freedoms we  will guarantee. These choices are all about architecture: about what kind of code will govern cyberspace, and who will control it. In this  realm, code is the most significant form of law, and it is up to lawyers, policymakers, and especially citizens to decide what values that code  embodies. <P> Since its original publication, this seminal book has earned the status of  a minor classic. This second edition, or Version 2.0, has been prepared  through the author's wiki, a web site that allows readers to edit the  text, making this the first reader-edited revision of a popular book.}},

They also help to make experienced programmers more productive by simplifying the organization of a program through the use of visual representations. However, visual languages have not reached their full potential because of several problems including the following: difficulty of producing visual representations for the more abstract computing constructs; the lack of adequate computing power to update the visual representations in response to user actions; the immaturity of the subfield of visual programming and need for additional breakthroughs and standardization of existing mechanisms. Visualization of Vision Algorithms ({VIVA}) is a proposed visual language for image processing. Its main purpose is to serve as an effective teaching tool for students of image processing. Its design also takes account of several secondary goals, including the completion of a software platform for research in human/image interaction, the creation of a vehicle for studying algorithms and architectures for parallel image processing, and the establishment of a presentation medium for image-processing algorithms.},

However, conclusions about linguistic processing (e.g., about activation, competition, and timing of access of linguistic representations) in the absence of relevant visual information must be drawn with caution.

    abstract = {Most people understand a computation as a process evoked when a computational agent acts on its inputs under the control of an algorithm. The classical Turing machine model has long served as the fundamental reference model because an appropriate Turing machine can simulate every other computational model known. The Turing model is a good abstraction for most digital computers because the number of steps to execute a Turing machine algorithm is predictive of the running time of the computation on a digital computer. However, the Turing model is not as well matched for the natural, interactive, and continuous information processes frequently encountered today. Other models whose structures more closely match the information processes involved give better predictions of running time and space. Models based on transforming representations may be useful.},

    abstract = {Computer models for determining key boundaries are important tools for computer analysis of music, computational modeling of music cognition, content-based categorization and retrieval of music information and automatic generating of expressive performance. This paper proposes a Boundary Search Algorithm ({BSA}) for determining points of modulation in a piece of music using a geometric model for tonality called the Spiral Array. For a given number of key changes, the computational complexity of the algorithm is polynomial in the number of pitch events. We present and discuss computational results for two selections from {J.S}. Bach's  ” A Little Notebook for Anna Magdalena”. Comparisons between the choices of an expert listener and the algorithm indicates that in human cognition, a dynamic interplay exists between memory and present knowledge, thus maximizing the opportunity for the information to coalesce into meaningful patterns.},

@article{Kirsch10,
    abstract = {Why do people create extra representations to help them make sense of situations, diagrams, illustrations, instructions and problems? The obvious explanation—external representations save internal memory and computation—is only part of the story. I discuss seven ways external representations enhance cognitive power: they change the cost structure of the inferential landscape; they provide a structure that can serve as a shareable object of thought; they create persistent referents; they facilitate re-representation; they are often a more natural representation of structure than mental representations; they facilitate the computation of more explicit encoding of information; they enable the construction of arbitrarily complex structure; and they lower the cost of controlling thought—they help coordinate thought. Jointly, these functions allow people to think more powerfully with external representations than without. They allow us to think the previously unthinkable.},

A variety of research methods were employed including ethnographic methods, questionnaires and interviews. An online personality test based on the {Myers-Briggs} Type Indicator ({MBTI}) was used to ascertain the personality types, and questionnaires were used throughout the project to measure levels of cohesiveness. Examples of how the teams worked together throughout the project are described, and whether and how this relates to the personality types of the individual members. The results indicate that certain teams were found to work consistently well over the project due to homogeneity in personality type and others were found to be very cohesive due to a mixture of types.},

    abstract = {It has been argued that most end-users would not want to write programs, no matter what kind of tools they had to help them. This paper analyzes the reasons for that situation, and addresses them with a new approach to programming. There is a large class of users who are very reluctant to create any kind of abstraction within a computer (they will not create a new directory, let alone a Word macro). But these people do create abstractions in their everyday lives outside the computer. The reason for their computer habits can be explained in terms of a simple investment and risk model. See What You Need ({SWYN}) is a system intended to deliver the capabilities—not just of Word macros, but of Perl—to end-users. The techniques it adopts are those of programming by example, visual program representation and direct manipulation. {SWYN} is not intended to be a complete system, and is unlikely to develop into a complete Perl replacement. It is a research vehicle, supporting the evaluation of specific features aimed at reducing the perceived risk of abstraction in programming. This paper describes two elements of the {SWYN} project, both of them related to the regular expressions that are central to pattern matching in Perl. The first is a prototype system that acquires regular expressions from the type of examples required in direct manipulation of data for programming. The second is an experimental evaluation of alternative notations for visualizing regular expressions. This experiment demonstrated a clear advantage for graphical notations in typical end-user tasks, both over conventional regular expressions, and over a tutorial-style textual notation. The overall effect is a reduction both in programming investment and in perceived risk.},

In a similar way, the graphical interface puts the user into a uniform world of tangible objects that can be direcdy manipulated and changed without switching modes. The implementation strives to support the world-of-objects illusion by minimizing perceptible pauses and by providing true source-level semantics without sacrificing performance. As a side benefit, it encourages factoring.

In order to facilitate tasks such as the creation and sharing of knowledge in teams, we propose a collaborative dimensions framework as a tool for understanding how visual artefacts can facilitate collaboration in circumstances that involve distributed knowledge. The framework is based on the widespread Cognitive Dimensions of Notation framework and is enriched with criteria from the boundary object paradigm discussed in organization science. The dimensions of the framework are described and then applied to three different visualizations that are used in collaborative knowledge work.

Decentralization comes with both the promise of new data and the peril of its misinterpretation. We focus on git, a very popular {DSCM} used in high-profile projects. Decentralization, and other features of git, such as automatically recorded contributor attribution, lead to richer content histories, giving rise to new questions such as  ” How do contributions flow between developers to the official project repository?” However, there are pitfalls. Commits may be reordered, deleted, or edited as they move between repositories. The semantics of terms common to {SCMs} and {DSCMs} sometimes differ markedly, potentially creating confusion. For example, a commit is immediately visible to all developers in centralized {SCMs}, but not in {DSCMs}. Our goal is to help researchers interested in {DSCMs} avoid these and other perils when mining and analyzing git data.},

    abstract = {Time series segmentation is a promising approach to discover temporal patterns from time-stamped numeric data. A novel approach to apply time series segmentation to discern temporal information from software version repositories is proposed. Data from such repositories, both numeric and non-numeric, are represented as item-set time series data. A dynamic programming algorithm for optimal segmentation is presented. The algorithm automatically produces a compacted item-set time series that can be analyzed to identify temporal patterns. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by analyzing version control repositories of several open-source projects to identify time-varying patterns of developer activity. The experimental results show that the segmentation algorithm produces segments that capture meaningful information and is superior to the information content obtained by arbitrarily segmenting software history into regular time intervals.

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Building repositories of computational models of biological systems ensures that published models are available for both education and further research, and can provide a source of smaller, previously verified models to integrate into a larger {model.One} problem with earlier repositories has been the limitations in facilities to record the revision history of models. Often, these facilities are limited to a linear series of versions which were deposited in the repository. This is problematic for several reasons. Firstly, there are many instances in the history of biological systems modelling where an 'ancestral' model is modified by different groups to create many different models. With a linear series of versions, if the changes made to one model are merged into another model, the merge appears as a single item in the history. This hides useful revision history information, and also makes further merges much more difficult, as there is no record of which changes have or have not already been merged. In addition, a long series of individual changes made outside of the repository are also all merged into a single revision when they are put back into the repository, making it difficult to separate out individual changes. Furthermore, many earlier repositories only retain the revision history of individual files, rather than of a group of files. This is an important limitation to overcome, because some types of models, such as {CellML} 1.1 models, can be developed as a collection of modules, each in a separate {file.The} need for revision history is widely recognised for computer software, and a lot of work has gone into developing version control systems and distributed version control systems ({DVCSs}) for tracking the revision history. However, to date, there has been no published research on how {DVCSs} can be applied to repositories of computational models of biological {systems.RESULTS}:We have extended the Physiome Model Repository software to be fully revision history aware, by building it on top of Mercurial, an existing {DVCS}. We have demonstrated the utility of this approach, when used in conjunction with the model composition facilities in {CellML}, to build and understand more complex models. We have also demonstrated the ability of the repository software to present version history to casual users over the web, and to highlight specific versions which are likely to be useful to {users.CONCLUSIONS}:Providing facilities for maintaining and using revision history information is an important part of building a useful repository of computational models, as this information is useful both for understanding the source of and justification for parts of a model, and to facilitate automated processes such as merges. The availability of fully revision history aware repositories, and associated tools, will therefore be of significant benefit to the community.},

    abstract = {What was I working on before the weekend? and What were the members of my team working on during the last week? are common questions that are frequently asked by a developer. They can be answered if one keeps track of who changes what in the source code. In this work, we present Replay, a tool that allows one to replay past changes as they happened at a fine-grained level, where a developer can watch what she has done or understand what her colleagues have done in past development sessions. With this tool, developers are able to not only understand what sequence of changes brought the system to a certain state (e.g., the introduction of a defect), but also deduce reasons for why her colleagues performed those changes. One of the applications of such a tool is also discovering the changes that broke the code of a developer.},

@article{Chen04,
    abstract = {A recent editorial in Empirical Software Engineering suggested that open-source software projects offer a great deal of data that can be used for experimentation. These data not only include source code, but also artifacts such as defect reports and update logs. A common type of update log that experimenters may wish to investigate is the {ChangeLog}, which lists changes and the reasons for which they were made. {ChangeLog} files are created to support the development of software rather than for the needs of researchers, so questions need to be asked about the limitations of using them to support research. This paper presents evidence that the {ChangeLog} files provided at three open-source web sites were incomplete. We examined at least three {ChangeLog} files for each of three different open-source software products, namely, {GNUJSP}, {GCC}-g++, and Jikes. We developed a method for counting changes that ensures that, as far as possible, each individual {ChangeLog} entry is treated as a single change. For each {ChangeLog} file, we compared the actual changes in the source code to the entries in the {ChangeLog}> file and discovered significant omissions. For example, using our change-counting method, only 35 of the 93 changes in version 1.11 of Jikes appear in the {ChangeLog} file—that is, over 62\% of the changes were not recorded there. The percentage of omissions we found ranged from 3.7 to 78.6\%. These are significant omissions that should be taken into account when using {ChangeLog} files for research. Before using {ChangeLog} files as a basis for research into the development and maintenance of open-source software, experimenters should carefully check for omissions and inaccuracies.},

We observed that important changes to software artifacts are sometimes accompanied by numerous non-essential modifications, such as local variable refactorings, or textual differences induced as part of a rename refactoring. We developed a tool-supported technique for detecting non-essential code differences in the revision histories of software systems. We used our technique to investigate code changes in over 24,000 change sets gathered from the change histories of seven long-lived open-source systems. We found that up to 15.5\% of a system's method updates were due solely to non-essential differences. We also report on numerous observations on the distribution of non-essential differences in change history and their potential impact on change-based analyses.},

We define code decay and propose a number of measurements (code decay indices) on software and on the organizations that produce it, that serve as symptoms, risk factors, and predictors of decay. Using an unusually rich data set (the fifteen-plus year change history of the millions of lines of software for a telephone switching system), we find mixed, but on the whole persuasive, statistical evidence of code decay, which is corroborated by developers of the code. Suggestive indications that perfective maintenance can retard code decay are also discussed.},

Visualizations of software history that provide only static views do not capture the dynamic nature of software evolution. We present a new visualization technique, the Evolution Storyboard, which provides dynamic views of the evolution of a software's structure. An evolution storyboard consists of a sequence of animated panels, which highlight the structural changes in the system; one panel for each considered time period. Using storyboards, engineers can spot good design, signs of structural decay, or the spread of cross cutting concerns in the code. We implemented our concepts in a tool, which automatically extracts software dependency graphs from version control repositories and computes storyboards based on panels for different time periods. For applying our approach in practice, we provide a step by step guide that others can follow along the storyboard visualizations, in order to study the evolution of large systems. We have applied our method to several large open source software systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that our method provides additional information (compared to static views) on the {ArgoUML} project, an open source {UML} modeling tool.},

    abstract = {Identifying code duplication in large multi-platform software systems is a challenging problem. This is due to a variety of reasons including the presence of high-level programming languages and structures interleaved with hardware-dependent low-level resources and assembler code, the use of {GUI}-based configuration scripts generating commands to compile the system, and the extremely high number of possible different configurations. This paper studies the extent and the evolution of code duplications in the Linux kernel. Linux is a large, multi-platform software system; it is based on the Open Source concept, and so there are no obstacles in discussing its implementation. In addition, it is decidedly too large to be examined manually: the current Linux kernel release (2.4.18) is about three million {LOCs}. Nineteen releases, from 2.4.0 to 2.4.18, were processed and analyzed, identifying code duplication among Linux subsystems by means of a metric-based approach. The obtained results support the hypothesis that the Linux system does not contain a relevant fraction of code duplication. Furthermore, code duplication tends to remain stable across releases, thus suggesting a fairly stable structure, evolving smoothly without any evidence of degradation.},

@article{Tucker05,
    abstract = {This paper describes a novel framework for classifying underwater transient signals recorded by passive sonar. The proposed approach involves two key ideas. Firstly, a feature-selection algorithm is used to identify those acoustic features that optimally model each class of transient sound. Secondly, features that are perceptually motivated are proposed, i.e., they encode information that human listeners are likely to use in transient classification tasks. Three perceptual features are proposed, which encode timbre, the physical material of the sound source, and the temporal context (pattern) in which the transient occurred. The authors show how these features, which are computed over different temporal windows, can be combined to make classification decisions. The performance of the proposed classifier is evaluated on a corpus of transient signals extracted from passive sonar recordings. Specifically, the performance of the perceptual features is compared with spectral features and with those that encode statistics of time, frequency, and power. The present results show that the perceptual features provide valuable cues to the class of a transient. However, the best performing classifier was obtained by selecting a subset of perceptual, spectral, and statistical features in a class-dependent manner.},

    abstract = {A study by a {ITiCSE} 2001 working group ("the {McCracken} Group") established that many students do not know how to program at the conclusion of their introductory courses. A popular explanation for this incapacity is that the students lack the ability to problem-solve. That is, they lack the ability to take a problem description, decompose it into sub-problems and implement them, then assemble the pieces into a complete solution. An alternative explanation is that many students have a fragile grasp of both basic programming principles and the ability to systematically carry out routine programming tasks, such as tracing (or "desk checking") through code. This {ITiCSE} 2004 working group studied the alternative explanation, by testing students from seven countries, in two ways. First, students were tested on their ability to predict the outcome of executing a short piece of code. Second, students were tested on their ability, when given the desired function of short piece of near-complete code, to select the correct completion of the code from a small set of possibilities. Many students were weak at these tasks, especially the latter task, suggesting that such students have a fragile grasp of skills that are a prerequisite for problem-solving.},

    abstract = {This paper investigates the effect of larynx position on the articulatory abilities of a human-like vocal tract. Previous work has investigated models that were built to resemble the anatomy of existing species or fossil ancestors. This has led to conflicting conclusions about the relation between the evolution of anatomy and the evolution of speech. Here a model is proposed to systematically investigate the relation between larynx height and articulatory abilities. It is a simplified model of primate vocal anatomy that nevertheless preserves the essential articulatory constraints due to limitations of muscular control. It is found that there is an optimal larynx height at which the largest range of signals can be produced and that at this height, the vertical and horizontal parts are approximately equally long. This has been a conjecture for a long time by those researchers of the evolution of speech who propose that the human vocal tract has evolved for speech. A short recapitulation of acoustic theory of speech production is presented to explain the reason for why this configuration is {optimal.The} optimal configuration corresponds closely to human female anatomy, while in the human male the larynx is slightly lower than optimal. These results agree with the hypothesis that modern human vocal anatomy has evolved because of speech, and that male larynx position might have been lowered further for reasons of size exaggeration.},

                When we observe someone performing an action, do our brains simulate making that action? Acquired motor skills offer a unique way to test this question, since people differ widely in the actions they have learned to perform. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study differences in brain activity between watching an action that one has learned to do and an action that one has not, in order to assess whether the brain processes of action observation are modulated by the expertise and motor repertoire of the observer. Experts in classical ballet, experts in capoeira and inexpert control subjects viewed videos of ballet or capoeira actions. Comparing the brain activity when dancers watched their own dance style versus the other style therefore reveals the influence of motor expertise on action observation. We found greater bilateral activations in premotor cortex and intraparietal sulcus, right superior parietal lobe and left posterior superior temporal sulcus when expert dancers viewed movements that they had been trained to perform compared to movements they had not. Our results show that this 'mirror system' integrates observed actions of others with an individual's personal motor repertoire, and suggest that the human brain understands actions by motor simulation.

@article{Chong08,
    abstract = {Mirror neurons, as originally described in the macaque, have two defining properties [1, 2]: They respond specifically to a particular action (e.g., bringing an object to the mouth), and they produce their action-specific responses independent of whether the monkey executes the action or passively observes a conspecific performing the same action. In humans, action observation and action execution engage a network of frontal, parietal, and temporal areas. However, it is unclear whether these responses reflect the activity of a single population that represents both observed and executed actions in a common neural code or the activity of distinct but overlapping populations of exclusively perceptual and motor neurons [3]. Here, we used {fMRI} adaptation to show that the right inferior parietal lobe ({IPL}) responds independently to specific actions regardless of whether they are observed or executed. Specifically, responses in the right {IPL} were attenuated when participants observed a recently executed action relative to one that had not previously been performed. This adaptation across action and perception demonstrates that the right {IPL} responds selectively to the motoric and perceptual representations of actions and is the first evidence for a neural response in humans that shows both defining properties of mirror neurons.},

Two types of musical permutations were used, including retrograde and inverse. In a retrograde permutation, the criterion melody was played backward in the test melody, and in an inverse permutation, an ascending or descending interval in the criterion melody became an opposite in the test melody. Subjects included 32 male and 64 female undergraduates at the University of Toronto. Regression analysis clearly showed that it was easiest to compare short retrograde permutations and that accuracy at discerning retrograde permutations predicted accuracy at judging spatial rotations. The implication is that a higher order ability to discriminate contour underlies both kinds of judgments. },

Amusia cannot be explained as a simple sensory impairment. Here we show that amusia is strongly related to a deficit in spatial processing in adults. Compared to two matched control groups (musicians and non-musicians), participants in the amusic group were significantly impaired on a visually presented mental rotation task. Amusic subjects were also less prone to interference in a spatial stimulus-response incompatibility task and performed significantly faster than controls in an interference task in which they were required to make simple pitch discriminations while concurrently performing a mental rotation task. This indicates that the processing of pitch in music normally depends on the cognitive mechanisms that are used to process spatial representations in other modalities.},

                Both language and music consist of sequences that are structured according to syntactic regularities. We used two specific event-related brain potential ({ERP}) components to investigate music-syntactic processing in children: the {ERAN} (early right anterior negativity) and the N5. The neural resources underlying these processes have been posited to overlap with those involved in the processing of linguistic syntax. Thus, we expected children with specific language impairment ({SLI}, which is characterized by deficient processing of linguistic syntax) to demonstrate difficulties with music-syntactic processing. Such difficulties were indeed observed in the neural correlates of music-syntactic processing: neither an {ERAN} nor an N5 was elicited in children with {SLI}, whereas both components were evoked in age-matched control children with typical language development. Moreover, the amplitudes of {ERAN} and N5 were correlated with subtests of a language development test. These data provide evidence for a strong interrelation between the language and the music processing system, thereby setting the ground for possible effects of musical training in {SLI} therapy.

    abstract = {{In <i>Things and Places,</i> Zenon Pylyshyn argues that the process of incrementally constructing perceptual representations, solving the binding problem (determining which properties go together), and, more generally, grounding perceptual representations in experience arise from the nonconceptual capacity to pick out and keep track of a small number of sensory individuals. He proposes a mechanism in early vision that allows us to select a limited number of sensory objects, to reidentify each of them under certain conditions as the same individual seen before, and to keep track of their enduring individuality despite radical changes in their properties--all without the machinery of concepts, identity, and tenses. This mechanism, which he calls FINSTs (for "Fingers of Instantiation"), is responsible for our capacity to individuate and track several independently moving sensory objects--an ability that we exercise every waking minute, and one that can be understood as fundamental to the way we see and understand the world and to our sense of space.<br /> <br /> Pylyshyn examines certain empirical phenomena of early vision in light of the FINST mechanism, including tracking and attentional selection. He argues provocatively that the initial selection of perceptual individuals is our primary nonconceptual contact with the perceptual world (a contact that does not depend on prior encoding of any properties of the thing selected) and then draws on a wide range of empirical data to support a radical externalist theory of spatial representation that grows out of his indexing theory.}},

We coin the term in-situ speech visualization to describe a variety of augmented-reality techniques by which graphic representations of speech can be made to appear coincident with their apparent point of origination.},

The innate component becomes more evident in rare situations in which the environment is markedly impoverished. The present study investigated the language production of a generation of deaf Nicaraguans who had not been exposed to a developed language. We examined the changing use of early linguistic structures (specifically, spatial modulations) in a sign language that has emerged since the Nicaraguan group first came together: In tinder two decades, sequential cohorts of learners systematized the grammar of this new sign language. We examined whether the systematicity being added to the language stems from children or adults: our results indicate that such changes originate in children aged 10 and younger Thus, sequential cohorts of interacting young children collectively: possess the capacity not only to learn, but also to create, language.},

    abstract = {Some Lisp programs such as Emacs, but also the Linux kernel (when fully modularised) are mostly dynamic; i.e., apart from a small static core, the significant functionality is dynamically loaded. In this paper, we explore fully dynamic applications in Haskell where the static core is minimal and code is hot swappable. We demonstrate the feasibility of this architecture by two applications: Yi, an extensible editor, and Lambdabot, a plugin-based {IRC} robot. Benefits of the approach include hot swappable code and sophisticated application configuration and extension via embedded {DSLs}. We illustrate both benefits in detail at the example of a novel embedded {DSL} for editor interfaces.},

Its design is inspired by current psycholinguistic and computational theories of human lexical memory. English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are organized into synonym sets, each representing one underlying lexicalized concept. Different relations link the synonym sets.  <P>The purpose of this volume is twofold. First, it discusses the design of WordNet and the theoretical motivations behind it.

@article{Fritz09,
    abstract = {It has long been debated which aspects of music perception are universal and which are developed only after exposure to a specific musical culture [15]. Here, we report a crosscultural study with participants from a native African population (Mafa) and Western participants, with both groups being naive to the music of the other respective culture. Experiment 1 investigated the ability to recognize three basic emotions (happy, sad, scared/fearful) expressed in Western music. Results show that the Mafas recognized happy, sad, and scared/fearful Western music excerpts above chance, indicating that the expression of these basic emotions in Western music can be recognized universally. Experiment 2 examined how a spectral manipulation of original, naturalistic music affects the perceived pleasantness of music in Western as well as in Mafa listeners. The spectral manipulation modified, among other factors, the sensory dissonance of the music. The data show that both groups preferred original Western music and also original Mafa music over their spectrally manipulated versions. It is likely that the sensory dissonance produced by the spectral manipulation was at least partly responsible for this effect, suggesting that consonance and permanent sensory dissonance universally influence the perceived pleasantness of music.},

    abstract = {This paper explores the differences in the design and performance of acoustic and new digital musical instruments, arguing that with the latter there is an increased encapsulation of musical theory. The point of departure is the phenomenology of musical instruments, which leads to the exploration of designed artefacts as extensions of human cognition – as scaffolding onto which we delegate parts of our cognitive processes. The paper succinctly emphasises the pronounced epistemic dimension of digital instruments when compared to acoustic instruments. Through the analysis of material epistemologies it is possible to describe the digital instrument as an epistemic tool: a designed tool with such a high degree of symbolic pertinence that it becomes a system of knowledge and thinking in its own terms. In conclusion, the paper rounds up the phenomenological and epistemological arguments, and points at issues in the design of digital musical instruments that are germane due to their strong aesthetic implications for musical culture.},

    abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to the definition of timbre as it pertains to the vowels of speech. There are two forms of size information in these  source-filter  sounds, information about the size of the excitation mechanism (the vocal folds), and information about the size of the resonators in the vocal tract that filter the excitation before it is projected into the air. The current definitions of pitch and timbre treat the two forms of size information differently. In this paper, we argue that the perception of speech sounds by humans suggests that the definition of timbre would be more useful if it grouped the size variables together and separated the pair of them from the remaining properties of these sounds.},

    abstract = {Although hearing is classically considered a temporal sense, everyday listening suggests that subtle spatial properties constitute an important part of what people know about the world through sound. Typically neglected in psychoacoustics research, the ability to perceive the precise sizes of objects on the basis of sound was investigated during the routine event of dropping wooden dowels of different lengths onto a hard surface. In two experiments, the ordinal and metrical success of naive listeners was related to length but not to the simple acoustic variables (duration, amplitude, frequency) likely to be related to it. Additional analysis suggests the potential relevance of an object's inertia tensor in constraining perception of that object's length, analogous to the case that has been made for perceiving length by effortful touch.},

    abstract = {British English and Singapore English are said to differ in rhythmic patterning. British English is commonly described as stress-timed, but Singapore English is claimed to be syllable-timed. In the present paper, we explore the acoustic nature of the suggested cross-varietal difference. In directly comparable samples from British English and Singapore English, two types of acoustic measurements were taken; we calculated a variability index reflecting changes in vowel length over utterances, and measurements reflecting vowel quality. Our findings provide acoustic data which support the hypothesized cross-varietal difference in rhythmic patterning; we show (1) that successive vowel durations are more nearly equal in Singapore English than in British English, and (2) that reduced vowels pattern more peripherally in the {F1/F2} formant space in Singapore English than in British English. We complete the paper with a comparison of our vowel variability index with a set of acoustic measures for rhythm proposed by Ramus, Nespor, and Mehler (1999), which focus on variability in vocalic and intervocalic intervals. We conclude that our variability index is more successful in capturing rhythmic differences than Ramus et al. (1999)'s measures, and that an application of our index to Ramus et al.'s intervocalic measure may provide a further diagnostic of rhythmic class.},

    abstract = {Two experiments were performed to evaluate the perceptual relationships between 16 music instrument tones. The stimuli were computer synthesized based upon an analysis of actual instrument tones, and they were perceptually equalized for loudness, pitch, and duration. Experiment 1 evaluated the tones with respect to perceptual similarities, and the results were treated with multidimensional scaling techniques and hierarchic clustering analysis. A three‐dimensional scaling solution, well matching the clustering analysis, was found to be interpretable in terms of (1) the spectral energy distribution; (2) the presence of synchronicity in the transients of the higher harmonics, along with the closely related amount of spectral fluctuation within the the tone through time; and (3) the presence of low‐amplitude, high‐frequency energy in the initial attack segment; an alternate interpretation of the latter two dimensions viewed the cylindrical distribution of clusters of stimulus points about the spectral energy distribution, grouping on the basis of musical instrument family (with two exceptions). Experiment 2 was a learning task of a set of labels for the 16 tones. Confusions were examined in light of the similarity structure for the tones from experiment 1, and one of the family‐grouping exceptions was found to be reflected in the difficulty of learning the labels.},

We report here that many of these neurons become active also when the monkey observes specific, meaningful hand movements performed by the experimenters. The effective experimenters' movements include among others placing or retrieving a piece of food from a table, grasping food from another experimenter's hand, and manipulating objects. There is always a clear link between the effective observed movement and that executed by the monkey and, often, only movements of the experimenter identical to those controlled by a given neuron are able to activate it. These findings indicate that premotor neurons can retrieve movements not only on the basis of stimulus characteristics, as previously described, but also on the basis of the meaning of the observed actions.},

@article{Barsalou10,
    abstract = {Abstract Thirty years ago, grounded cognition had roots in philosophy, perception, cognitive linguistics, psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, and cognitive neuropsychology. During the next 20 years, grounded cognition continued developing in these areas, and it also took new forms in robotics, cognitive ecology, cognitive neuroscience, and developmental psychology. In the past 10 years, research on grounded cognition has grown rapidly, especially in cognitive neuroscience, social neuroscience, cognitive psychology, social psychology, and developmental psychology. Currently, grounded cognition appears to be achieving increased acceptance throughout cognitive science, shifting from relatively minor status to increasing importance. Nevertheless, researchers wonder whether grounded mechanisms lie at the heart of the cognitive system or are peripheral to classic symbolic mechanisms. Although grounded cognition is currently dominated by demonstration experiments in the absence of well-developed theories, the area is likely to become increasingly theory driven over the next 30 years. Another likely development is the increased incorporation of grounding mechanisms into cognitive architectures and into accounts of classic cognitive phenomena. As this incorporation occurs, much functionality of these architectures and phenomena is likely to remain, along with many original mechanisms. Future theories of grounded cognition are likely to be heavily influenced by both cognitive neuroscience and social neuroscience, and also by developmental science and robotics. Aspects from the three major perspectives in cognitive science—classic symbolic architectures, statistical/dynamical systems, and grounded cognition—will probably be integrated increasingly in future theories, each capturing indispensable aspects of intelligence.},

distinguished first of all by an inverse relation between the point and the
line (in the case of the striated, the line is between two points, while in the
smooth, the point is between two lines); and second, by the nature of the
line (smooth-directional, open intervals; dimensional-striated, closed intervals).
Finally, there is a third difference, concerning the surface or
space. In striated space, one closes off a surface and "allocates" it according
to determinate intervals, assigned breaks; in the smooth, one "distributes"
oneself in an open space, according to frequencies and in the course of
one's crossings (logos and nomos)" p480

"Perhaps we must say that all progress is made by and in striated space, but all becoming
occurs in smooth space." p486

Definition in terms of fractal dimensions:
  striated = whole number of dimensions
  smooth = construction of line with fractal dimension > 1, or surface with fractal dimension > 2

"... work constitutes a striated space-time corresponding to the State
apparatus ..."

"What interests us in
operations of striation and smoothing are precisely the passages or combinations:
how the forces at work within space continually striate it, and how
in the course of its striation it develops other forces and emits new smooth
spaces. Even the most striated city gives rise to smooth spaces: to live in the
city as a nomad, or as a cave dweller. Movements, speed and slowness, are
sometimes enough to reconstruct a smooth space. Of course, smooth
spaces are not in themselves liberatory. But the struggle is changed or displaced
in them, and life reconstitutes its stakes, confronts new obstacles,
invents new paces, switches adversaries. Never believe that a smooth space
will suffice to save us." p. 500},

In this paper we discuss the idea of programming as an activity that takes place within the temporal bounds of a real-time computational process and its interactions with the physical world. We ground these ideas within the con- text of livecoding -- a live audiovisual performance practice. We then describe how the development of the programming environment "Impromptu" has addressed our ideas of programming with time and the notion of the programmer as an agent in a cyber-physical system.},

@article{Zhang06,
    abstract = {Functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) combined with the paired-stimuli paradigms (referred as dynamic {fMRI}) was used to study the  illusory double-flash  effect on brain activity in the human visual cortex. Three experiments were designed. The first two experiments aimed to examine the cross-modal neural interaction between the visual and auditory sensory systems caused by the illusory double-flash effect using combined auditory (beep sound) and visual (light flash) stimuli. The {fMRI} signal in the visual cortex was significantly increased in response to the illusory double flashes compared to the physical single flash when the inter-stimuli delay between the auditory and visual stimuli was 25 ms. This increase disappeared when the delay was prolonged to \~{}300 ms. These results reveal that the illusory double-flash effect can significantly affect the brain activity in the visual cortex, and the degree of this effect is dynamically sensitive to the inter-stimuli delay. The third experiment was to address the spatial differentiation of brain activation in the visual cortex in response to the illusory double-flash stimulation. It was found that the illusory double-flash effect in the human visual cortex is much stronger in the periphery than the fovea. This finding suggests that the periphery may be involved in high-level brain processing beyond the retinotopic visual perception. The behavioral measures conducted in this study indicate an excellent correlation between the {fMRI} results and behavioral performance. Finally, this work demonstrates a unique merit of {fMRI} for providing both temporal and spatial information regarding cross-modal neural interaction between different sensory systems.},

In an attempt to resolve this dispute, we conducted a meta-analysis to decipher which hemisphere truly dominates and under what circumstances. It was found that across people and situations, the right hemisphere is the more dominant for spatial processing. However, consideration of specific moderator variables yielded a more complex picture. For example, females showed no hemisphere preference while males showed a right hemisphere advantage. Also, no hemisphere preference was indicated for spatial visualization tasks while subjects performing spatial orientation and manual manipulation tasks displayed a predictable right hemisphere preference. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for exiting theoretical positions as well as future empirical research.},

Kinematic facial information is isolated by darkening an actor's face and attaching dots to various articulators so that only moving dots can be seen with no facial features present. To test the salience of these images, the authors conducted experiments to determine whether the images could visually influence the perception of discrepant auditory syllables. Results showed that these images can influence auditory speech independently of the participant's knowledge of the stimuli. In other experiments, single frozen frames of visible syllables were presented with discrepant auditory syllables to test the salience of static facial features. Although the influence of the kinematic stimuli was perceptual, any influence of the static featural stimuli was likely based on participant's misunderstanding or postperceptual response bias.},

G\"{a}rdenfors' theory offers a way of bridging the traditional divide between symbolic and sub-symbolic representations, as well as the gap between representational formalism and meaning as perceived by human minds. We discuss how both these qualities may be advantageous from the point of view of artificial creative systems. We take music as our example domain, and discuss how a range of musical qualities may be instantiated as conceptual spaces, and present a detailed conceptual space formalisation of musical metre.},

Wolfram lets the world see his work in <I>A New Kind of Science</I>, a gorgeous, 1,280-page tome more than a decade in the making. With patience, insight, and self-confidence to spare, Wolfram outlines a fundamental new way of modeling complex systems.<p>  On the frontier of complexity science since he was a boy, Wolfram is a  champion of cellular automata--256 "programs" governed by simple  nonmathematical rules. He points out that even the most complex  equations fail to accurately model biological systems, but the simplest  cellular automata can produce results straight out of nature--tree  branches, stream eddies, and leopard spots, for instance. The graphics  in <I>A New Kind of Science</I> show striking resemblance to the  patterns we see in nature every day.<p>  Wolfram wrote the book in a distinct style meant to make it easy to read,   even for nontechies; a basic familiarity with logic is helpful but  not essential. Readers will find themselves swept away by the elegant  simplicity of Wolfram's ideas and the accidental artistry of the  cellular automaton models. Whether or not Wolfram's revolution  ultimately gives us the keys to the universe, his new science is  absolutely awe-inspiring. <I>--Therese Littleton</I>} {This long-awaited work from one of the world's most respected scientists presents a series of dramatic discoveries never before made public. Starting from a collection of simple computer experiments---illustrated in the book by striking computer graphics---Wolfram shows how their unexpected results force a whole new way of looking at the operation of our universe.  <P>Wolfram uses his approach to tackle a remarkable array of fundamental problems in science: from the origin of the Second Law of thermodynamics, to the development of complexity in biology, the computational limitations of mathematics, the possibility of a truly fundamental theory of physics, and the interplay between free will and determinism.  <P>Written with exceptional clarity, and illustrated by more than a thousand original pictures, this seminal book allows scientists and non-scientists alike to participate in what promises to be a major intellectual revolution.}},

We argue that a cognitive theory of peoples' reasoning performance must account for (a) the logical equivalence of inferences expressed in graphical and linguistic form, and (b) the implementational differences that affect facility of inference. Our theory proposes that graphical representation limit abstraction and thereby aid  ” processibility”. We discuss the ideas of specificity and abstraction, and their cognitive relevance. Empirical support both comes from tasks which involve the manipulation of external graphics and tasks that do not. For the former, we take Euler's (1772) circles, provide a novel computational reconstruction, show how it captures abstractions, and contrast it with earlier construals and with {Johnson-Laird}'s (1983) mental models representations. We demonstrate equivalence of the graphical Euler system, and the nongraphical mental models system. For tasks not involving manipulation of external graphics, we discuss text comprehension, and the mental performance of syllogisms. By positing an internal system with the same specificity as Euler's circles, we cover the mental models data, and generate new empirical predictions. Finally, we consider how the architecture of working memory explains why such specific representations are relatively easy to store.},

He concluded that scientists were either totally lacking in visual imagery or had  ” feeble” powers of mental imagery. This finding has been widely accepted in the secondary literature in psychology. A replication of Galton's study with modern scientists and modern university undergraduates found no scientists totally lacking in visual imagery and very few with feeble visual imagery. Examination of Galton's published data shows that his own published data do not support his claims about deficient visual imagery in scientists. The modern data for scientists and nonscientists and the 1880 data for scientists and nonscientists are in agreement in showing that all groups report substantial imagery on recollective memory tasks such as Galton's breakfast questionnaire. We conclude that Galton's conclusions were an example of theory-laden interpretation of data based on the initial responses from several very salient scientists who reported little or no visual imagery on Galton's imagery questionnaire. },

    abstract = {The term concreteness effect refers to the observation that concrete nouns are processed faster and more accurately than abstract nouns in a variety of cognitive tasks. Two models have been proposed to explain the neuronal basis of the concreteness effect. The dual-coding theory attributes the advantage to the access of a right hemisphere image based system in addition to a verbal system by concrete words. The context availability theory argues that concrete words activate a broader contextual verbal support, which results in faster processing, but do not access a distinct image based system. We used event-related {fMRI} to detect the brain regions that subserve to the concreteness effect. We found greater activation in the lower right and left parietal lobes, in the left inferior frontal lobe and in the precuneus during encoding of concrete compared to abstract nouns. This makes a single exclusive theory unlikely and rather suggests a combination of both models. Superior encoding of concrete words in the present study may result from (1) greater verbal context resources reflected by the activation of left parietal and frontal associative areas, and (2) the additional activation of a non-verbal, perhaps spatial imagery-based system, in the right parietal lobe. },

    comment = {Dual coding emphasizes the importance of nonverbal imagery as a mode
of thought that was distinct from, though coordinated with, verbal
processes.  This is in reaction to propositional theory, which holds
that all information, whether veral or non-verbal, is transformed into
a common descriptive format and then operated on by processes of a
similar form.

Points out that formal systems are incomplete (G\~{A}\^{A}{\P}del), that proofs and
refutations often rely on infromal psychological processes of
perception, imagery and creative discovery.  and that changes in
formal theory are motivated by non-formal processes.

On picture-like vs language-like representations, p17: "... a
consensus seems to be developing around the idea that the fundamental
distinguishing dimension is the degree of arbitrariness of the mappin
grelation between the form of the representation and the form of the
represented world.  Thus, the terms picture-like, analogue, iconic and
isomorphic all imply that such representations map onto represented
objects or events in a nonarbitrary way.  In the case of language-like
representations, on the other hand, the relation is completely
arbitrary."

On distinction between representation and process, p20: "... it is difficult to distinguish representational structure from representational function or process ... the structure of the E image is revealed only by the counting operation [of its corners]."

Representational concepts reviewed: mental image, memory trace, nonverbal mediators, verbal mediators and the logogen, cell assembly, template, prototype, schema, features, and propositions.

Three kinds  of processing: representational (e.g. naming words, imaging pictures), referential (e.g. imaging words, naming pictures) or associative (within system associations e.g. word association, triggering non-verbal memory from images of related situations).

Functions served by the two systems: Evaluative (scanning mental images to determine relative distances between locations on imaged maps / counting syllables in a word), Mnemonic (encoding in memory), and Motivational and emotional (representation in goal directed behaviour).},

qualitative difference or a matter of degree.

In the light of evidence, the claims of motor theory have become more
complex.  Motor theory has accounted for the fact that those unable to
speak from birth due to physical problems can nonetheless understand
speech, by claiming an internal model of the vocal tract is what
drives both speech perception and production.  Mole discounts this as
overly complex, and instead posits that resources that drive both
speech perception and production could simply drive one and not the

    abstract = {To study the development of graphical conventions we had members of a simulated community play a series of graphical interaction games with partners drawn from the same pool (Experiment 1). Once the community was established, a conventional referring scheme emerged that facilitated high levels of semantic coordination, with reduced communicative effort. Next, a forced choice reaction time study (Experiment 2) demonstrated that graphical conventions developed in communities offer a distinct processing advantage when compared with those developed by isolated pairs (i.e. participants who always interact with the same partner). This is interpreted as evidence that the graphical conventions that evolve within a closed community constitute higher order cognitions, the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. Background Vygotsky (1981) claims that higher order cognition is a product of social interaction, that novel structures emerge as a consequence of interpersonal, as opposed to intrapersonal, communication. Hutchins (1995) shares this view, arguing that higher order cognition is a cultural product, a consequence of interaction (humanenvironment and human-human) that is distributed across time and space. According to Hutchins, higher order cognitions emerge from  ” an adaptive process that accumulates partial solutions to frequently encountered problems ” (p.354). Lewis (1969, 1975) defines conventions in a comparable way, as arising from situations where a community faces the recurrent problem of coordination. If we agree that conventions are cultural products, should we accept that they represent higher order cognitions? Using Chinese characters as an},

We have shown how visal processing at each stage of the visual system can form the basis of design guidelines.  This model works well for early-stage sensory processing, where, for example, scientific color theory has provided the basis for the display devices that are ubiquitous.  It works less well at the higher levels of perception, where socially constructed codes are at least as important as innate neural mechanisms."},

This visual representation has serveral advantages over traditional textual and visual calculators. {VLM} uses typed Mind Maps for both the lambda calculator input and ouput. Although {VLM} is designed as a computable typed Mind Maps node of our Typed Mind Maps {API} project [1], it can also be applied to learning and teaching the concepts of lambda calculus as a visualization of traditional textual rewrite steps.

@book{Allen02,
    abstract = {{With first-chapter allusions to martial arts, "flow," "mind like water," and other concepts borrowed from the East (and usually mangled), you'd almost think this self-helper from David Allen should have been called <I>Zen and the Art of Schedule Maintenance</I>.<p>  Not quite. Yes, <I>Getting Things Done</I> offers a complete system for downloading all those free-floating gotta-do's clogging your brain into a sophisticated framework of files and action lists--all purportedly to free your mind to focus on whatever you're working on. However, it still operates from the decidedly Western notion that if we could just get really, really organized, we could turn ourselves into 24/7 productivity machines. (To wit, Allen, whom the New Economy bible <I>Fast Company</I> has dubbed "the personal productivity guru,"  suggests that instead of meditating on crouching tigers and hidden dragons while you wait for a plane, you should unsheathe that high-tech saber known as the cell phone and attack that list of calls you need to return.)<p>  As whole-life-organizing systems go, Allen's is pretty good, even fun and therapeutic. It starts with the exhortation to take every unaccounted-for scrap of paper in your workstation that you can't junk, The next step is to write down every unaccounted-for gotta-do cramming your head onto its own scrap of paper. Finally, throw the whole stew into a giant "in-basket" <p>  That's where the processing and prioritizing begin; in Allen's system, it get a little convoluted at times, rife as it is with fancy terms, subterms, and sub-subterms for even the simplest concepts. Thank goodness the spine of his system is captured on a straightforward, one-page flowchart that you can pin over your desk and repeatedly consult without having to refer back to the book. That alone is worth the purchase price. Also of value is Allen's ingenious Two-Minute Rule: if there's anything you absolutely must do that you can do right now in two minutes or less, then do it now, thus freeing up your time and mind tenfold over the long term. It's commonsense advice so obvious that most of us completely overlook it, much to our detriment; Allen excels at dispensing such wisdom in this useful, if somewhat belabored, self-improver aimed at everyone from CEOs to soccer moms (who we all know are more organized than most CEOs to start with). --<I>Timothy Murphy</I>} {<P> <B>In today's world of exponentially increased communication and responsibility, yesterday's methods for staying on top just don't work.</B> <P> Veteran management consultant and trainer David Allen recognizes that "time management" is useless the minute your schedule is interrupted; "setting priorities" isn't relevant when your email is down; "procrastination solutions" won't help if your goals aren't clear. <P> Allen's premise is simple: our ability to be productive is directly proportional to our ability to relax. Only when our minds are clear and our thoughts are organized can we achieve stress-free productivity and unleash our creative potential. He teaches us how to: <P> <UL TYPE=CIRCLE> 	<LI>Apply the "do it, delegate it, defer it, drop it" rule to get your in-box empty<BR> 	<LI>Reassess goals and stay focused in changing situations<BR> 	<LI>Overcome feelings of confusion, anxiety, and being overwhelmed<BR> 	<LI>Feel fine about what you're not doing<BR> </UL> <P> From core principles to proven tricks, <I>Getting Things Done</I> has the potential to transform the way you work -- and the way you experience work. At any level of implementation, David Allen's entertaining and thought-provoking advice shows you how to pick up the pace without wearing yourself down.} {"""The personal productivity guru"" (Fast Company) delivers powerful methods that vastly increase your efficiency and creative results-at work and in life  In today's world, yesterday's methods just don't work. In Getting Things Done, veteran coach and management consultant David Allen shares the breakthrough methods for stress-free performance that he has introduced to tens of thousands of people across the country. Allen's premise is simple: our productivity is directly proportional to our ability to relax. Only when our minds are clear and our thoughts are organized can we achieve effective productivity and unleash our creative potential. In Getting Things Done Allen shows how to:  Apply the ""do it, delegate it, defer it, drop it"" rule to get your in-box to empty  Reassess goals and stay focused in changing situations  Plan projects as well as get them unstuck  Overcome feelings of confusion, anxiety, and being overwhelmed  Feel fine about what you're not doing  From core principles to proven tricks, Getting Things Done can transform the way you work, showing you how to pick up the pace without wearing yourself down."}},

    abstract = {{It has been more than twenty years since desktop publishing reinvented design, and it's clear that there is a growing need for designers and artists to learn programming skills to fill the widening gap between their ideas and the capability of their purchased software. This book is an introduction to the concepts of computer programming within the context of the visual arts. It offers a comprehensive reference and text for Processing (www.processing.org), an open-source programming language that can be used by students, artists, designers, architects, researchers, and anyone who wants to program images, animation, and interactivity.<br /> <br /> The ideas in <i>Processing</i> have been tested in classrooms, workshops, and arts institutions, including UCLA, Carnegie Mellon, New York University, and Harvard University. Tutorial units make up the bulk of the book and introduce the syntax and concepts of software (including variables, functions, and object-oriented programming), cover such topics as photography and drawing in relation to software, and feature many short, prototypical example programs with related images and explanations. More advanced professional projects from such domains as animation, performance, and typography are discussed in interviews with their creators. "Extensions" present concise introductions to further areas of investigation, including computer vision, sound, and electronics. Appendixes, references to other material, and a glossary contain additional technical details. <i>Processing</i> can be used by reading each unit in order, or by following each category from the beginning of the book to the end. The Processing software and all of the code presented can be downloaded and run for future exploration.<br /> <br /> <b>With essays by:</b><br /> Alexander R. Galloway, Golan Levin, R.

Several laboratories have been unable to confirm the existence of the effect despite two positive reports from the original laboratory. The authors of the original studies have provided a list of key procedural components to produce the effect. This experiment attempted to produce a Mozart effect by following those procedural instructions and replicating the procedure of one of the original positive reports. The experiment failed to produce either a statistically significant Mozart effect or an effect size suggesting practical significance. This general lack of effect is consistent with previous work by other investigators. We conclude that there is little evidence to support basing intellectual intervention programs on the existence of the Mozart effect.},

We begin by acknowledging that we may be a little disadvantaged, in that consciousness studies do not form part of the engineering curriculum, and so we may be starting from a position of considerable ignorance as regards the study of consciousness itself. In practice, however, this may not set us back very far; almost a decade ago, Crick wrote: \&\#{039;Everyone} has a rough idea of what is meant by consciousness. It is better to avoid a precise definition of consciousness because of the dangers of premature definition. Until the problem is understood much better, any attempt at a formal definition is likely to be either misleading or overly restrictive, or both\&\#039; (Crick, 1994). This seems to be as true now as it was then, although the identification of different aspects of consciousness (P-consciousness, A-consciousness, self consciousness, and monitoring consciousness) by Block (1995) has certainly brought a degree of clarification. On the other hand, there is little doubt that consciousness does seem to be something to do with the operation of a sophisticated control system (the human brain), and we can claim more familiarity with control systems than can most philosophers, so perhaps we can make up some ground there.},

This book provides eloquent support for the idea that spontaneous neuron activity, far from being mere noise, is actually the source of our cognitive abilities. It takes a fresh look at the co-evolution of structure and function in the mammalian brain, illustrating how self-emerged oscillatory timing is the brains fundamental organizer of neuronal information. The small world-like connectivity of the cerebral cortex allows for global computation on multiple spatial and temporal scales. The perpetual interactions among the multiple network oscillators keep cortical systems in a highly sensitive metastable state and provide energy-efficient synchronizing mechanisms via weak links.   In a sequence of cycles, Gyorgy Buzsaki guides the reader from the physics of oscillations through neuronal assembly organization to complex cognitive processing and memory storage. His clear, fluid writing  accessible to any reader with some scientific knowledge  is supplemented by extensive footnotes and references that make it just as gratifying and instructive a read for the specialist. The coherent view of a single author who has been at the forefront of research in this exciting field, this volume is essential reading for anyone interested in our rapidly evolving understanding of the brain.}},

The body of work of such sound-based music (which includes electroacoustic art music, turntable composition, computer games, and acoustic and digital sound installations) has developed more rapidly than its musicology. <i>Understanding the Art of Sound Organization</i> proposes the first general foundational framework for the study of the art of sound organization, defining terms, discussing relevant forms of music, categorizing works, and setting sound-based music in interdisciplinary contexts.<br /> <br /> Leigh Landy's goal in this book is not only to create a theoretical framework but also to make sound-based music more accessible--to give a listener what he terms "something to hold on to," for example, by connecting elements in a work to everyday experience. Landy considers the difficulties of categorizing works and discusses such types of works as sonic art and electroacoustic music, pointing out where they overlap and how they are distinctive. He proposes a "sound-based music paradigm" that transcends such traditional categories as art and pop music. Landy defines patterns that suggest a general framework and places the study of sound-based music in interdisciplinary contexts, from acoustics to semiotics, proposing a holistic research approach that considers the interconnectedness of a given work's history, theory, technological aspects, and social impact.<br /> <br /> The author's ElectroAcoustic Resource Site (EARS, www.ears.dmu.ac.uk), the architecture of which parallels this book's structure, offers updated bibliographic resource abstracts and related information.}},

Describes Soft vs Hard programming, or bricoleur versus structured programming.

Bricoleur programmers start with a simple working program and shapes it gradually by successive modifications.  They are uncomfortable with making parts of their code opaque.  When dealing with programs made by others, the situation is reversed.  Bricoleur programmers are happy learning about code by interacting with it, while structured programmers demand to know how it works through dissection.

Nice example of female children working out relationships between gear wheels in relation to movements of their body.  Embodied reasoning.},

After training subjects to respond to 18 conditional relations, subjects' accuracy and speed of accurate responding were compared across trial types (baseline, symmetry, transitivity, and combined transitivity and symmetry) and nodal distance (one- through five-node transitive and combined transitive and symmetric relations). Differences in accuracy across nodal distance and trial type were significant only on the first tests of equivalence, whereas differences in speed were significant even after extended testing. Response speed was inversely related to the number of nodes on which the tested relations were based. Significant differences in response speed were also found across trial types, except between transitivity and combined trials. To determine the generality of these comparisons, three groups of subjects were included: An instructed group was given an instruction that specified the interchangeability of stimuli related through training; a queried group was queried about the basis for test-trial responding: and a standard group was neither instructed nor queried. There were no significant differences among groups. These results suggest the use of response speed and response accuracy to measure the strength of matching relations.},

@book{Turkle05,
    abstract = {{In <i>The Second Self</i>, Sherry Turkle looks at the computer not as a "tool," but as part of our social and psychological lives; she looks beyond how we use computer games and spreadsheets to explore how the computer affects our awareness of ourselves, of one another, and of our relationship with the world. "Technology," she writes, "catalyzes changes not only in what we do but in how we think." First published in 1984, <i>The Second Self</i> is still essential reading as a primer in the psychology of computation. This twentieth anniversary edition allows us to reconsider two decades of computer culture--to (re)experience what was and is most novel in our new media culture and to view our own contemporary relationship with technology with fresh eyes. Turkle frames this classic work with a new introduction, a new epilogue, and extensive notes added to the original text.<br /> <br /> Turkle talks to children, college students, engineers, AI scientists, hackers, and personal computer owners--people confronting machines that seem to think and at the same time suggest a new way for us to think--about human thought, emotion, memory, and understanding. Her interviews reveal that we experience computers as being on the border between inanimate and animate, as both an extension of the self and part of the external world. Their special place betwixt and between traditional categories is part of what makes them compelling and evocative. (In the introduction to this edition, Turkle quotes a PDA user as saying, "When my Palm crashed, it was like a death. I thought I had lost my mind.") Why we think of the workings of a machine in psychological terms--how this happens, and what it means for all of us--is the ever more timely subject of <i>The Second Self</i>.}},

In work presented here, we used a well-known multisensory illusion called the {McGurk} effect to show that synaesthesia is driven by late, perceptual processing, rather than early, unisensory processing. Specifically, we tested 9 linguistic-color synaesthetes and found that the colors induced by spoken words are related to what is perceived (i.e., the illusory combination of audio and visual inputs) and not to the auditory component alone. Our findings indicate that color-speech synaesthesia is triggered only when a significant amount of information processing has occurred and that early sensory activation is not directly linked to the synaesthetic experience.},

Their evolution is traced through several critical periods: early work on lambda calculus and combinatory calculus, Lisp, Iswim, {FP}, {ML}, and modern functional languages such as Miranda1 and Haskell. The fundamental premises on which the functional programming methodology stands are critically analyzed with respect to philosophical, theoretical, and pragmatic concerns. Particular attention is paid to the main features that characterize modern functional languages: higher-order functions, lazy evaluation, equations and pattern matching, strong static typing and type inference, and data abstraction. In addition, current research areas—such as parallelism, nondeterminism, input/output, and state-oriented computations—are examined with the goal of predicting the future development and application of functional languages.},

    abstract = {Timbre is defined as the attribution of spectromorphological identity. Electroacoustic music experience, particularly acousmatic music, questions the viability of a notion of timbre. Of primary significance is the traditional linking of timbre to the source and cause of a sound: the concept of source-cause texture is introduced to define this link. The ambiguous relationship between pitch and timbre indicates that timbre cannot be defined as that part of the sound which is not pitch. Problems in establishing the existence of sonic identities within the musical context, and of maintaining the coherence of identities are discussed, opening up questions relating to musical discourse. Two types of discourse  transformational and typological  are defined, leading to the notion of generic timbre. In a spectromorphological music where defining identities becomes problematic it becomes impossible to disentangle timbre from discourse: here the notion of timbre has a limited viability.},

uncanny way. Interpreters of aerial photographs develop similar skills. We are a

perception of the outside world, but a further stage, the creation of new patterns."

"Creativity comes when we apply our abstractions and spatial logic in a new
situation. If the kitchen door keeps blowing open and a woman puts down a brick to
keep it shut, then she has been creative; for bricks exist to build houses with, not
shut doors. Creativity is not verbalised, not voluntary, but something which we do
spontaneously. "

    abstract = {Synaesthesia is a fascinating condition whereby individuals report extraordinary experiences when presented with ordinary stimuli. Here we examined an individual (L) who experiences  time  units (i.e., months of the year and hours of the day) as occupying specific spatial locations (January is 30° to the left of midline). This form of  time-space  synaesthesia has been recently investigated by Smilek et al. (2007) who demonstrated that synaesthetic  time-space  associations are highly consistent, occur regardless of intention, and can direct spatial attention. We extended this work by showing that for the synaesthete L, her  time-space  vantage point changes depending on whether the  time  units are seen or heard. For example, when L sees the word {JANUARY}, she reports experiencing January on her left side, however when she  hears  the word  ” January” she experiences the month on her right side. L's subjective reports were validated using a spatial cueing paradigm. The names of months were centrally presented followed by targets on the left or right. L was faster at detecting targets in validly cued locations relative to invalidly cued locations both for visually presented cues (January orients attention to the left) and for aurally presented cues (January orients attention to the right). We replicated this difference in visual and aural cueing effects using hour of the day. Our findings support previous research showing that  time-space  synaesthesia can bias visual spatial attention, and further suggest that for this synaesthete,  time-space  associations differ depending on whether they are visually or aurally induced.},

A corpus analysis of the standard Java documentation revealed the range of conceptual metaphors shared by library authors and users of packages such as java.util and java.bean. These metaphors included the expected mental models of internal program behaviour, but also consistent references to a spatial image-world with material properties and flows. More surprisingly, program components are metaphorically understood as actors with beliefs and intentions, working together according to social relationships. Rather than mechanical imperative models or mathematical declarative ones, it seems that one of the most widespread bases for conceptual models of programming is of social entities that act as proxies for their developers.

                Predictive processing of information is essential for goal-directed behavior. We offer an account of auditory perception suggesting that representations of predictable patterns, or 'regularities', extracted from the incoming sounds serve as auditory perceptual objects. The auditory system continuously searches for regularities within the acoustic signal. Primitive regularities may be encoded by neurons adapting their response to specific sounds. Such neurons have been observed in many parts of the auditory system. Representations of the detected regularities produce predictions of upcoming sounds as well as alternative solutions for parsing the composite input into coherent sequences potentially emitted by putative sound sources. Accuracy of the predictions can be utilized for selecting the most likely interpretation of the auditory input. Thus in our view, perception generates hypotheses about the causal structure of the world.

@article{Ramachandran01,
    abstract = {
                We studied two otherwise normal, synaesthetic subjects who 'saw' a specific colour every time they saw a specific number or letter. We conducted four experiments in order to show that this was a genuine perceptual experience rather than merely a memory association. (i) The synaesthetically induced colours could lead to perceptual grouping, even though the inducing numerals or letters did not. (ii) Synaesthetically induced colours were not experienced if the graphemes were presented peripherally. (iii) Roman numerals were ineffective: the actual number grapheme was required. (iv) If two graphemes were alternated the induced colours were also seen in alternation. However, colours were no longer experienced if the graphemes were alternated at more than 4 Hz. We propose that grapheme colour synaesthesia arises from 'cross-wiring' between the 'colour centre' (area V4 or V8) and the 'number area', both of which lie in the fusiform gyrus. We also suggest a similar explanation for the representation of metaphors in the brain: hence, the higher incidence of synaesthesia among artists and poets.

Participants were asked to verbalize why they either liked or disliked two different kinds of paintings; one piece was representational, the other piece was abstract. Those who verbalized their reasons for liking the artworks were more likely to prefer the representational painting, whereas those who verbalized their reasons for disliking the paintings were also more likely to dislike the representational painting. While it was easy to describe reasons for both liking and disliking representational art, the same proved difficult for abstract art. The findings suggest that due to its figurative qualities people will be encouraged to generate reasons to describe representational art, rather than abstract art, and that these reasons could potentially be biased and cause them to change their preferences in line with these reasons.},

    abstract = {{ABSTRACT2014}"Holding warm feelings toward someone" and "giving someone the cold shoulder" indicate different levels of social proximity. In this article, we show effects of temperature that go beyond these metaphors people live by. In three experiments, warmer conditions, compared with colder conditions, induced (a) greater social proximity, (b) use of more concrete language, and (c) a more relational focus. Different temperature conditions were created by either handing participants warm or cold beverages (Experiment 1) or placing them in comfortable warm or cold ambient conditions (Experiments 2 and 3). These studies corroborate recent findings in the field of grounded cognition revealing that concrete experiences ground abstract concepts with which they are coexperienced. Our studies show a systemic interdependence among language, perception, and social proximity: Environmentally induced conditions shape not only language use, but also the perception and construal of social relationships.},

Although perceiving speech begins with auditory processing, investigation of speech perception has progressed mostly independently of study of the auditory system. Nevertheless, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that cross-fertilization between the two areas of research can be productive. We briefly describe research bridging the study of general auditory processing and speech perception, showing that the latter is constrained and influenced by operating characteristics of the auditory system and that our understanding of the processes involved in speech perception is enhanced by study within a more general framework. The disconnect between the two areas of research has stunted the development of a truly interdisciplinary science, but there is an opportunity for great strides in understanding with the development of an integrated field of auditory cognitive science.},

The aim of the present experiment was to investigate the possible combination of emotional and endocrine changes in response to techno-music and to define personality variables as predictors of respective changes. Sixteen psychosomatically healthy subjects (18- to 19-year-olds, eight males and eight females) were exposed, in random order, to techno-music or to classical music (30 min each). Plasma norepinephrine ({NE}), epinephrine ({EPI}), growth hormone ({GH}), prolactin ({PRL}), adrenocorticotropic hormone ({ACTH}) cortisol ({CORT}), \^{I}²-endorphin ({\^{I}²-EP}) concentrations and changes of emotional state were measured in basal conditions and after the experimental trials with two different types of music. Techno-music was associated with a significant increase in heart rate, systolic blood pressure and significant changes in self-rated emotional states. A significant increase was observed in {\^{I}²-EP}, {ACTH}, {NE}, {GH} and {CORT} after listening to techno-music. Classical music induced an improvement in emotional state, but no significant changes in hormonal concentrations. No differences between male and female subjects' responses to music have been found. Plasma levels of {PRL} and {EPI} were unaffected by techno- and classical music. Changes in emotional state and {NE}, {\^{I}²-EP} and {GH} responses to techno-music correlated negatively with harm avoidance scores and positively with the novelty-seeking temperament score on the Cloninger scale. Listening to techno-music induces changes in neurotransmitters, peptides and hormonal reactions, related to mental state and emotional involvement: personality traits and temperament may influence the wide inter-individual variability in response to music.},

Music makes reference to the interior world of emotions or physiological states, not the outside world.

"The Kaluli describe melodic intervals - whether in their own music or in the music of others - with the same terms they use to characterize features of waterfalls."

A melodic line that descends to a repeated note is described with the same phrase 'sa-mogan' as describes a waterfall flowing into a pool.

    abstract = {A psychophysical investigation of timbre was undertaken with the intent of deriving quantitative results that could be useful in musical applications. Recordings of metal objects being struck with percussion mallets were rated by subjects on a unidimensional perceptual scale of perceived mallet hardness. Four acoustical parameters of the attack portion (first 325 ms) were defined and evaluated as predictors of perceived mallet hardness rating. To measure these parameters, a critical-band filter bank was employed. Two curves were extracted from the filter-bank output: (1) spectral level (log of area under spectrum) over time, and (2) spectral centroid over time. For each curve, two parameters were measured: the mean and the slope of the spectral level curve, and the mean and the time-weighted average of the spectral centroid curve. Multiple regression analysis was used to relate the perceptual ratings to these four acoustical parameters, and a good fit was achieved (multiple R-squared=0.725, F=1135.8, p<0.01). The resulting function is suitable for quantitatively predicting the perceptual dimension of perceived mallet hardness.},

Listeners heard sentences describing objects, spoken at varying speaking rates. After each sentence, participants saw a picture of an object and judged whether it had been mentioned in the sentence. Participants were faster to recognize the object when motion implied by speaking rate matched the motion implied by the picture.

    abstract = {This paper presents studies of the coordination of voluntary human arm movements. A mathematical model is formulated which is shown to predict both the qualitative features and the quantitative details observed experimentally in planar, multijoint arm movements. Coordination is modeled mathematically by defining an objective function, a measure of performance for any possible movement. The unique trajectory which yields the best performance is determined using dynamic optimization theory. In the work presented here, the objective function is the square of the magnitude of jerk (rate of change of acceleration) of the hand integrated over the entire movement. This is equivalent to assuming that a major goal of motor coordination is the production of the smoothest possible movement of the hand. Experimental observations of human subjects performing voluntary unconstrained movements in a horizontal plane are presented. They confirm the following predictions of the mathematical model: unconstrained point-to-point motions are approximately straight with bell-shaped tangential velocity profiles; curved motions (through an intermediate point or around an obstacle) have portions of low curvature joined by portions of high curvature; at points of high curvature, the tangential velocity is reduced; the durations of the low-curvature portions are approximately equal. The theoretical analysis is based solely on the kinematics of movement independent of the dynamics of the musculoskeletal system and is successful only when formulated in terms of the motion of the hand in extracorporal space. The implications with respect to movement organization are discussed.},

The basic idea is that the performer uses \&\#8220;phrase final lengthening\&\#8221; as a device to reflect some internal representation of the phrase structure. The representation is based on Lardahl and Jackendoff's time-span reduction. The basic heuristic in the model is recursive involving look-ahead and planning at a number of levels. The planned phrasings are superposed beat by beat and the output from the program is a list of durations which could easily be adapted to be sent to a synthesiser given a suitable system.},

    abstract = {There are two widely divergent theories about the relation of speech to language. The more conventional view holds that the elements of speech are sounds that rely for their production and perception on two wholly separate processes, neither of which is distinctly linguistic. Accordingly, the primary motor and perceptual representations are inappropriate for linguistic purposes until a cognitive process of some sort has connected them to language and to each other. The less conventional theory takes the speech elements to be articulatory gestures that are the primary objects of both production and perception. Those gestures form a natural class that serves a linguistic function and no other. Therefore, their representations are immediately linguistic, requiring no cognitive intervention to make them appropriate for use by the other components of the language system. The unconventional view provides the more plausible answers to three important questions: (1) How was the necessary parity between speaker and listener established in evolution, and how maintained? (2) How does speech meet the special requirements that underlie its ability, unique among natural communication systems, to encode an indefinitely large number of meanings? (3) What biological properties of speech make it easier than the reading and writing of its alphabetic transcription?},

Compares auditory (horizontal) to articulatory (vertical) theory of speech perception and production.  Auditory theory is where general neural resources are responsible for speech perception and production, that biology is not specialized for language, production is secondary to perception, the elements of speech are sounds, speech perception is like general sound perception.  Articulatory (vertical) theory is where the units of speech are articulatory gestures of a vocal tract, co-evolved with a speech module in the brain for both production and perception of speech. 

Such a polarised view looks a little like a straw man argument.  It can however be read as showing a specific widely accepted view as extreme, and proposing one specific alternative, which happens to be the theory of the authors.

Oddly, sees paralinguistic phrasing as horizontal: "It should be emphasized at this point that the concern of this essay is only with the production and perception of phonetic structure, for there can surely be no argument about the purely auditory (hence horizontal) nature of such paralinguistic aspects of the signal as the register, loudness and timbre of the speaker's voice."

This study aimed to investigate whether enhanced perceptual processing was a core property of synaesthesia by contrasting tactile and colour sensitivity in synaesthetes who experience either colour, touch, or both touch and colour as evoked sensations. For comparison the performance of non-synaesthetic control subjects was also assessed. There was a relationship between the modality of synaesthetic experience and the modality of sensory enhancement.

Previous research has not taken account of the possibility that deaf people will show greater heterogeneity in how they experience voice-hallucinations due to individual differences in experience with language and residual hearing.

    comment = {Presents experiment where deaf people who 'hear voices', with range of histories (e.g. born profoundly deaf/partially deaf) are surveyed to characterise their voice hearing experience.  Found the nature and duration of their deafness had great impact on the experience.  


Focusing on "Factor A", those profoundly deaf from birth (or before language development):

Those with prelingual deafness or profoundly deaf from birth heard non-auditory, clear and easy to understand.  They considered questions of pitch, volume and loudness irrelevant to their experiences, but nonetheless associated gender and identity to the voice.  Apart from one subject (who saw God's moustache), images of the voice seen appeared to be subvisual in nature, distinct from true visual hallucinations.  Otherwise, usually only the language articulators (i.e. hands and lips) were seen, generally moving, faint and unclear, and not interfering with normal vision.  The subjects found it difficult to give qualitative descriptions of the imagery (e.g b+w / colour), one account:

"All my voices sign to me, deaf school kids and the pope, even though he is hearing. I
am not sure how I can communicate but voice is projected into my brain, it moves
in my thoughts . . . hands and lips move and glow in my mind. It's blurry but I
understand it like daydreaming or watching a film . . . like a ghost with a camera in
my head. (translated from BSL)"

The subjects in this group reported they could see subvisual imagery, but did not perceive the voice as being located in front of them, more widely believed to originate inside the head than outside.  The voice was not perceived as physically sensual in terms of hearing or sight, but rather subjects "just knew" what they were saying and that they might be understood via telepathy.

This study provides compelling evidence supporting articulatory based models of thought:

"It is likely that deaf people's thought processes, like those of hearing
people, are based primarily on an articulatory code which remains largely
preconscious and closed to introspection. It is possible that thoughts
encoded in terms of premotor articulations enter explicit awareness during
voice-hallucinations, leading to the perception of articulatory percepts,
which are interpreted as alien to the self. These ''voices'' usually take an
auditory-verbal form in hearing individuals because the brain associates
speech articulations with audible speech (McDonald \& McGurk, 1978)."

    abstract = {▪ Abstract  A category of stimuli of great importance for primates, humans in particular, is that formed by actions done by other individuals. If we want to survive, we must understand the actions of others. Furthermore, without action understanding, social organization is impossible. In the case of humans, there is another faculty that depends on the observation of others' actions: imitation learning. Unlike most species, we are able to learn by imitation, and this faculty is at the basis of human culture. In this review we present data on a neurophysiological mechanism—the mirror-neuron mechanism—that appears to play a fundamental role in both action understanding and imitation. We describe first the functional properties of mirror neurons in monkeys. We review next the characteristics of the mirror-neuron system in humans. We stress, in particular, those properties specific to the human mirror-neuron system that might explain the human capacity to learn by imitation. We conclude by discussing the relationship between the mirror-neuron system and language.},

    abstract = {When historian Charles Weiner found pages of Nobel Prize-winning physicist
Richard Feynman's notes, he saw it as a "record" of Feynman's work. Feynman
himself, however, insisted that the notes were not a record but the work
itself. In Supersizing the Mind, Andy Clark argues that our thinking doesn't
happen only in our heads but that "certain forms of human cognizing include
inextricable tangles of feedback, feed-forward and feed-around loops: loops
that promiscuously criss-cross the boundaries of brain, body and world." The
pen and paper of Feynman's thought are just such feedback loops, physical
machinery that shape the flow of thought and enlarge the boundaries of mind.
Drawing upon recent work in psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, artificial
intelligence, robotics, human-computer systems, and beyond, Supersizing the
Mind offers both a tour of the emerging cognitive landscape and a sustained
argument in favor of a conception of mind that is extended rather than "brain-
bound." The importance of this new perspective is profound. If our minds
themselves can include aspects of our social and physical environments, then
the kinds of social and physical environments we create can reconfigure our
minds and our capacity for thought and reason.},

    abstract = {In {\_Aesthetic} Computing\_, key scholars and practitioners from art, design,
computer science, and mathematics lay the foundations for a discipline that
applies the theory and practice of art to computing. Aesthetic computing
explores the way art and aesthetics can play a role in different areas of
computer science. One of its goals is to modify computer science by the
application of the wide range of definitions and categories normally
associated with making art. For example, structures in computing might be
represented using the style of Gaudi or the Bauhaus school. This goes beyond
the usual definition of aesthetics in computing, which most often refers to
the formal, abstract qualities of such structures—a beautiful proof, or an
elegant diagram. The contributors to this book discuss the broader spectrum of
aesthetics—from abstract qualities of symmetry and form to ideas of creative
expression and pleasure—in the context of computer science. The assumption
behind aesthetic computing is that the field of computing will be enriched if
it embraces all of aesthetics. Human-computer interaction will
benefit—"usability," for example, could refer to improving a user's emotional
state—and new models of learning will emerge.


{\_Aesthetic} Computing\_ approaches its subject from a variety of perspectives.
After defining the field and placing it in its historical context, the book
looks at art and design, mathematics and computing, and interface and
interaction. Contributions range from essays on the art of visualization and
"the poesy of programming" to discussions of the aesthetics of mathematics
throughout history and transparency and reflectivity in interface design.

    comment = {A number of threads supporting the hypothesis of a universal 'frequency code':

== Universal tendencies for fundamental frequency (f0) and sentence type ==

Tendency to use high and/or rising F0 to mark questions, especially yes/no questions, and low and/or falling F0 to mark statements.  There are exceptions but the correlation is strong.  Attempts to explain via physiology have not been successful.

== The affective use of F0 ==

Anecdotal and experimental evidence in general agreement that there are cross-culturally similar uses of F0 to signal affect, intention or emotion.

Evidence has methodological problems and so is not extensive but it seems safe to conclude that such 'social' messages as deference, politeness, submission, lack of confidence are signaled by high and/or rising f0 whereas assertiveness, authority, aggression, confidence, threat are conveyed by low and/or falling f0.

Experimental results suggest that sometimes higher F0 can be perceived as having greater confidence, because this leads to a steeper 'terminal fall' in f0.

== Tone in sound symbolism ==

High tone tends to be associated with words denoting or connoting SMALL (and related concepts e.g. DIMINUTIVE, FAMILIAR, NEAR or NARROW), whereas low tone is associated with the notion LARGE, etc.

== F0 in nonhuman vocalizations ==

Cross-species similarity in form-function relationship of the acoustic component of 'close-contact agonistic displays\# (ie face-to-face competitive encounters).  Confident aggressor sounds are rough and have a low F0, submissive / non-threatening cries are tone-like with high F0, e.g. the dog's threatening growl and submissive whine/yelp.  Explained by morton (1977) by noting F0 s.is lower in bigger animals, and bigger membranes are more likely to have secondary vibrations giving rise to irregular / rough voice quality.  I.e., sound conveys an impression of size of signaler.

Perhaps high/rising tone of the questioner is from the same root, signalling subordination in someone who needs help.  In contrast, the person making a statement is self-sufficient.

== Facial expression ==

Suggests the origin of the smile is also as a signal of size, resonant affects suggesting a smaller vocaliser, and the o-face doing the opposite.

== Consonants and vowels in sound symbolism ==

Words denoting/connoting SMALL or SMALLNESS exhibit disproportionate incidence of vowels and/or consonants characterised by high acoustic frequency, and vice versa.  

== Sexual dimorphism of the vocal anatomy ==

The adult male larynx is approximately 50\% larger than the adult female's in the anterior-posterior dimension, but less in the lateral dimension.  That is, in precisely the way that gives the male longer vocal cords and thus lower F0.  The larynx is also longer, giving 15 - 20\% longer vocal tract, giving lower resonances.  Suggests this is to enhance aggressive displays -- strong evidence for an innate frequency code.},

    comment = {Optional processes in similarity judgments

Separable dimensions (e.g. colour saturation and brightness) give
similarity measure with cityblock distance, and interactive dimensions
give euclidean distance (e.g. circle diameter orientation and size)
and so are (arguably) compared as perceptual whole.

However similarity judgements, including stroop interference can be
based on optional processes, not mandatory ones, with subjects highly
sensitive to the given instructions.

Integral dimensions - yield performance gain in speeded classification
whenever and however dimensions are correlated.  This crosstalk is
thought to be restricted to a sensory/perception level of processing.

Configural dimensions - geometric dimensions (e.g. height and width)
whose interaction can create a third, emergent dimension.

Corresponding dimensions - those whose pairing entails a
correspondence, e.g. cross-modal auditory pitch and visual vertical
position that move together.

Introduces results of three MDS studies, one for each category
(corresponding pitch/position, integral pitch/loudness, configural
left/right parenthesis pairs).  In all three cases subjects instructed
to make judgements based on wholes did so according to euclidean
distance, and those based on focussing on dimensions did so according
to city block distance.

"for all known forms of dimensional interaction, the structure of the
similarity space is determined largely by where subjects focus their
attention."

Optional processes undermine claims about the nature of underlying
cognitive representations, and make it difficult to identify
fundamental properties of processing.

"... mandatory processes can only be uncovered by first identifyingand
isolating the optional processes that contextualize them."

Subjects are sometimes (a) unaware of the existence of a stimulus that importantly influenced a response, (b) unaware of the existence of the response, and (c) unaware that the stimulus has affected the response. It is proposed that when people attempt to report on their cognitive processes, that is, on the processes mediating the effects of a stimulus on a response, the do not do so on the basis of any true introspection. Instead, their reports are based on a priori, implicit casual theories or judgments about the extent to which a particular stimulus is a plausible cause of a given response. This suggests that though people may not be able to observe directly their cognitive processes, the will sometimes be able to report accurately about them. Accurate reports will occur when influential stimuli are salient and are plausible causes of the responses they produce, and will not occur the stimuli are not salient or are not plausible causes.},

Nelson Goodman's (1972) argument against similarity - it's meaningless
without a frame of reference. Similarity of A to B is an ill-defined,
meaningless notion unless one can say "in what respects" A is similar
to B.

This paper argues similarity is indeed quite flexible, but to counter
Goodman's argument is "fixed by the similarity comparison process" and
that ongoing research provides respects for similarity.

Three types of similarity:
1/ Similarity measured indirectly - e.g. using confusion errors to reveal underlying similarity (the more similar, the more likely confusion is likely (e.g. smith 1980 http://is.gd/xuvv, new/old memory tests (Gillund \& Shiffrin 1984), similar/different tests (more similar the stimuli, the longer the response time and more likely stimuli will be incorrectly judged to be the same).
2/ Direct judgements of similarity - e.g. my MDS pilot
3/ Similarity as a theoretical construct - models of cognition, which assume that similarity is either directly or indirectly computed.

Reviews criticism for similarity, including of MDS studies,
e.g. Melara, Marks and Lesko (1992) found euclidean vs city block
distance varied according to test subject instructions.

Through experiment finds similarity is "disturbingly flexible", where
respects (dimensions) are fixed by the nature of the comparison
process.

Functions of similarity:

1/ heuristic - allowing educated guesses in the face of limited
knowledge, for example guessing the danger of an unknown snake.
2/ comparison - explicit similarity comparisons and similes.  Can be
assymmetrical.

Property activation and comparison - There may be many ways in which
e.g. two countries can be compared, and it's not feasable that all are
activated in a comparison.  Comparison therefore involves a search for
properties (well, domains) to compare.

Alignment and structure - "... bringing aspects of the entities into
correspondaence" "roughly the same as the process of structural
alignment in analogical mapping".  Result depends on the context of
the particular comparison.

Reviews context effects.

Takes these views:

Similarity is not hard-wired - performance may vary with processing
time and previous experience, perceptual and conceptual similarity are
related, perceptual similarity is only shown to be stable in
particular circumstances and can be shown to be dynamic and context
dependent..

Similarity can vary with experience and context, are highly variable
but bound to the details of the comparison process.


"Nelson Goodman (1972) called similarity a chameleon, but we believe
that similarity is more like two yoked chameleons: The entities
entering into a comparison jointly constrain one another and jointly
determine the outcome of a similarity comparison. (That is,
paradoxically, two chameleons may behave in a more orderly manner than
one.)  Thus, similarity is changeable and context dependent but
systematically fixed in context.  This systematicity allows a person
to understand what other people mean when they say "X is similar to
Y," even when they do not explicitly mention respects.  Our studies
show that people's judgments of similarity reflect constraints that
serve to fix respects.  In short, although the comparison process is
dynamic, it is also lawful."

Implication for similarity theories

1/ Similarity comparisons involve mutually constraining property
instantiation and interpretations.

2/ Similarity comparisons are informative and may be directional

3/ Respects associated with assessments are influenced by the
comparison context

4/ comparisons involve alignment driven by global constraint
satisfaction

5/ contribution of a mathc to similarity comparisons depends on the
overall pattern of correspondences between entities.


"When researchers ask people "How similar are X and Y?" it is as if
people are answering the subtly different question "How are X and Y
similar?"  That is, a critical aspect of similarity comparisons is the
procedure for fixing respects."

Why so daunting? "Cognitive science--the empirical study of the mind--calls upon us to create a new, empirically responsible philosophy, a philosophy consistent with empirical discoveries about the nature of mind," they write. "A serious appreciation of cognitive science requires us to rethink philosophy from the beginning, in a way that would put it more in touch with the reality of how we think." In other words, no Platonic forms, no Cartesian mind-body duality, no Kantian pure logic. Even Noam Chomsky's generative linguistics is revealed under scrutiny to have substantial problems.<p>  Parts of <I>Philosophy in the Flesh</I> retrace the ground covered in the authors' earlier  <i>Metaphors We Live By</i>, which revealed how we deal with abstract concepts through metaphor. (The previous sentence, for example, relies on the metaphors "Knowledge is a place" and "Knowing is seeing" to make its point.) Here they reveal the metaphorical underpinnings of basic philosophical concepts like time, causality--even morality--demonstrating how these metaphors are rooted in our embodied experiences. They repropose philosophy as an attempt to perfect such conceptual metaphors so that we can understand how our thought processes shape our experience; they even make a tentative effort toward rescuing spirituality from the heavy blows dealt by the disproving of the disembodied mind or "soul" by reimagining "transcendence" as "imaginative empathetic projection." Their source list is helpfully arranged by subject matter, making it easier to follow up on their citations.

"The mind is inherently embodied.  Thought is mostly unconscious.  Abstract concepts are largely metaphorical.  These are three major findings of cognitive science."

When taken together these findings are incompatible with central parts of western philosophy.

"Reason ... is shaped crucially by the peculiarities of our human bodies, by the remarkable details of the neural structure of our brains, and by the specifics of our everyday functioning in the world."

"The neural structures of our brains produce conceptual systems and liguistic structures that cannot be adequately accounted for by formal systems that only manipulate symbols."

Two meanings of "cognitive" - in cognitive science, "any kind of mental operation or structure that can be studied in precise terms", e.g. visual and auditory processing, memory, attention, language processing etc.  Most of this is unconscious.  In some philosophical traditions "cognitive" means only conceptual or propositional structure and cognitive meaning is seen a truth-conditional meaning.  Confusing.

    comment = {Four common data collection methods for MDS:

* Sorting task (sort into a number of groups)
* Paired comparisons task (ordinal 9 point scale)
* Conditional rankings task (order stimuli on basis of similarity with anchor stimulus)
* Triadic combinations task (which two stimuli of combinations of three form the most similar and which the least similar)

Three factors in differing effects:

* Partial/complete blocking
* Difficulty of task
* Number of evaluations required

= Research questions =

== Differing effects on (a) fatigue, (b) boredom (c) stimulus knowledge (d) task insight

From review: Humphreys (1982) did not find significant differences in test-retest reliability between above methods.

Results: Fatigue and boredom lowest for sorting, somewhat higher for paired comparisons, markedly higher for conditional rankings and triadic combinations.  Stimulus knowledge and task insight constant across methods, so little evidence for learning effects in MDS judgment tasks.

== Differing effects on (a) completion time (b) occurrence of missing values ==

From review: Configurations are highly similar in general.

Results: Sorting fastest (mean of 3.2 min), followed by paired comparisons (7.8 min with) conditional ranking and triadic combinations (incomplete design using 80 out of 220 triads) taking 19.3 and 18.7 min respectively.  Paired comparisons has highest percentage who completed whole task (83.7\%), conditional ranking and sorting is slighly lower.  Triadic combinations have lowest of only 60\% completing all judgments.

== Differences with respect to (a) the recovered dimensionality (b) the amount of error (c) the recovered coordinates ==

From review: Knowledge rather incomplete and fragmented.

Results: 2D solution found for sorting and paired comparisons and 3D for conditional rankings and triadic combinations.  Error variance substantially lower for sorting (and to a lesser extent paired comparisons) than for conditional rankings and triadic combinations, indicating sorting data (and to lesser extent paired comparisons) are represented best by distances obtained with MAXSCAL. Note: doesn't seem surprising considering lower dimensionality of solution...

The perceptual map derived with MAXSCAL from paired comparison data represents the 'common underlying perceptual map' best.

Apparently, conditional ranking and triadic combinations extracts more information from the subjects. 

Dimensions 2 and 3 are both interpreted as representing country-of-origin, dimension 2 being japanese/south-european and dimension 3 separating german automobiles from other brands...

= Conclusion =

Trade off between amount of information (triadic combinations and conditional ranking) and lack of fatigue/boredom/high completion time (sorting and paired comparisons).

Sorting is fast, causing less fatigue but yields little informations for individual subjects, so no individual perceptual maps.},

    comment = {From chapter 2:

Highlights problem with ASA definition of timbre as "ill-defined wastebasket category".  The definition implies that sounds with timbre must have pitch (not sure about this -- you could say that two sounds without pitch have the same pitch).  A tone pulsed twice per second does not differ in timbre from one puled three times.  Tones pulse 20 times per second are different from those pulsed 40 times.  Concludes that the ASA definition should be "We do not know how to define timbre, but it is not loudness and it is not pitch".

Posits that loudness and pitch are excluded because they are founded on simple, easy to manipulate properties of sound.  Indeed when we find a cross-instrument, easy to manipulate characteristic such as vibrato, it tends to be given a label and no longer falls into the nameless wastebasket of "timbre".

Discusses MDS.  "... what you get out of the analysis depends on what you put in."  Studies limited to particular sounds, so listeners attend to most salient two to four dimensions, and those come out.  If you add sounds to the test which differ in other ways, dimensions from the original test may be lost from the results.  Also, no attempt made to find mathematical properties behind the dimensions that could allow them to be identified in new sounds without doing the same PCA.

From chapter 5:

p.481
"The fact that a sound can resemble different things in different ways leads naturally to the idea of dimensions of similarity".

In spiritedand graceful prose, {Johnson-Laird} argues that we apprehend the world bybuilding inner mental replicas of the relations among objects and events thatconcern us. The mind is essentially a model-building device that can itself bemodeled on a digital computer. This book provides both a blueprint forbuilding such a model and numerous important illustrations of how to do {it.In} several key areas of cognition, {Johnson-Laird} shows how an explanationbased on mental modeling is clearly superior to previous theory. For example,he argues compellingly that deductive reasoning does not take place by tacitlyapplying the rules of logic, but by mentally manipulating models of the statesof affairs from which inferences are drawn. Similarly, linguisticcomprehension is best understood not as a matter of applying inference rulesto propositions derived from sentences, but rather as the mind's effort toconstruct and update a model of the situation described by a text or adiscourse. Most provocative, perhaps, is {Johnson-Laird}'s theory ofconsciousness: the mind's necessarily incomplete model of itself allows only apartial control over the many unconscious and parallel processes of {cognition.This} an extraordinarily rich book, providing a coherent account of much recentexperimental work in cognitive psychology, along with lucid explanations ofrelevant theory in linguistics, computer science, and philosophy Not {sinceMiller}, Galanter, and Pribram's classic {\_Plans} and the Structure of Behavior\_has a book in cognitive science combined such sweep, style, and good {sense.Like} its distinguished predecessor, {\_Mental} Models\_ may well serve to fix apoint of view for a generation.},

    abstract = {Abstract The question why synaesthesia, an atypical binding within or between modalities, occurs is both enduring and important. Two explanations have been provided: (1) a congenital explanation: we are all born as synaesthetes but most of us subsequently lose the experience due to brain development; (2) a learning explanation: synaesthesia is related to some learning process during childhood. Three recent studies provide conflicting support for these explanations. Two studies supported the idea that synaesthesia is learned by showing that the frequency of everyday language implicitly modulates the synaesthetic experience. Another study argued that synaesthesia reflects basic, innate magnitude representations. In this paper we reassess these points of view, and show that it is possible for both to be valid. These findings are integrated into an interactive specialization account of development in order to explain the neuronal mechanism underlying synaesthesia.},

    abstract = {People make use of concepts in all aspects of their lives. Concepts are mental entities, which structure our experiences and support reasoning in the world. They are usually regarded as static, although there is ample evidence that they change over time with respect to structure, content, and relation to real-world objects and processes. Recent research considers concepts as dynamical systems, emphasizing this potential for change. In order to analyze the alteration of concepts in time, a formal representation of this process is necessary. This paper proposes an algebraic model for representing dynamic conceptual structures, which integrates two theories from geography and cognitive science, i.e., time geography and conceptual spaces. Such representation allows for investigating the development of a conceptual structure along space-time paths and serves as a foundation for querying the structure of concepts at a specific point in time or for a time interval. The geospatial concept of 'landmark' is used to demonstrate the formal specifications.},

    abstract = {{Our sense that a waltz is "in three" or a blues song is "in four with a shuffle" comes from our sense of musical meter. Hearing in Time explores musical meter from the point of view of cognitive theories of perception and attention. London explores how our ability to follow musical meter is simply a specific instance of our more general ability to synchronize our attention to regularly recurring events in our environment. As such, musical meter is subject to a number of fundamental perceptual and cognitive constraints, which form the cornerstones of London's account. Because listening to music, like many other rhythmic activities, is something that we often do, London views it as a skilled activity for performers and non-performers alike. Hearing in Time approaches musical meter in the context of music as it is actually performed, rather than as a theoretical ideal. Its approach is not based on any particular musical style or cultural practice, so it uses familiar examples from a broad range of music--Beethoven and Bach to Brubeck and Ghanaian drumming. Taking this broad approach brings out a number of fundamental similarities between a variety of different metric phenomena, such as the difference between so-called simple versus complex or additive meters. Because of its accessible style--only a modest ability to read a musical score is presumed--Hearing in Time is for anyone interested in rhythm and meter, including cognitive psychologists, musicologists, musicians, and music theorists.}},

Symbolic language allows humans to make their inner worlds known to

successful joint action can arise."

A fixpoint where through conversation both individuals reach a point
where they feel there is a mutual understanding.

                Based on accumulating evidence, simulation appears to be a basic computational mechanism in the brain that supports a broad spectrum of processes from perception to social cognition. Further evidence suggests that simulation is typically situated, with the situated character of experience in the environment being reflected in the situated character of the representations that underlie simulation. A basic architecture is sketched of how the brain implements situated simulation. Within this framework, simulators implement the concepts that underlie knowledge, and situated conceptualizations capture patterns of multi-modal simulation associated with frequently experienced situations. A pattern completion inference mechanism uses current perception to activate situated conceptualizations that produce predictions via simulations on relevant modalities. Empirical findings from perception, action, working memory, conceptual processing, language and social cognition illustrate how this framework produces the extensive prediction that characterizes natural intelligence.

    comment = {Survey of accumulated evidence supporting the author's theory of situated concepts -- being represented by simulations of aspects of perceptions.  Does not mention anything against the theory.

Simulation as "re-enactment of perceptual, motor and introspective states acquired during experience with the world, body and mind".

Seems to avoid talking about 'imagery' in this paper, apart from making the distinction between conscious and unconscious simulations.

Does not mention particular type of neurons such as mirror neurons.

States of perception, action and introspection are stored in long term memory, and then re-enacted as representation of concepts, useful when making predictions.

Simulators aggregate cross-modal information from across a category's instances.  They conceptualise the category by activating certain aspects of it as a simulation.  Which aspects get activated during a particular simulation depends on such things as recently, frequency and context.

Simulations are never exact reenactments of previously experienced category instances, but are partial, distorted and sometimes vague.

Purposes of simulations include: representing instances in their absence, inference and prediction production via pattern completion, conceptual combination, propositions in complex structures, representation of abstract concepts.   

Classic symbolic systems emerge implicitly from modal and association systems (rather than explicitly in the symbolic structures of calculus and frames).

Simulators develop whenever attention focuses repeatedly on a type of object (bicycle), action (pedaling), introspection (happiness) or relation (meshing of chain) in experience.

Concepts are not represented in isolation but in situations, after all perceptions always occur in situations.

A situated conceptualisation typically simulates (1) perceptions of relevant people/objects (2) actions (3) introspections) (4) settings.

Experiment 1 required detection of a change in control mode within trials. Experiments 2 and 3 introduced a simple rhythm reproduction task that requires discrimination of control modes between trials. The results demonstrate that both sensorimotor cues and perceptual cues are used to infer agency. In addition, there may be further influences of cognitive expectation and/or multimodal integration. In accordance with hierarchical models of intention [e.g., Pacherie, E. (2008). The phenomenology of action: A conceptual framework.

We tested that hypothesis by exposing listeners to folk melodies differing in metrical structure (simple or complex duration ratios), then testing them on alterations that preserved or violated the original metrical structure. Simple meters predominate in North American music, but complex meters are common in many other musical cultures. In Experiment 1, North American adults rated structure-violating alterations as less similar to the original version than structure-preserving alterations for simple-meter patterns but not for complex-meter patterns. In Experiment 2, adults of Bulgarian or Macedonian origin provided differential ratings to structure-violating and structure-preserving alterations in complex- as well as simple-meter contexts. In Experiment 3, 6-month-old infants responded differentially to structure-violating and structure-preserving alterations in both metrical contexts. These findings imply that the metrical biases of North American adults reflect enculturation processes rather than processing predispositions for simple meters.},

                To shed light on how humans can learn to understand music, we need to discover what the perceptual capabilities with which infants are born. Beat induction, the detection of a regular pulse in an auditory signal, is considered a fundamental human trait that, arguably, played a decisive role in the origin of music. Theorists are divided on the issue whether this ability is innate or learned. We show that newborn infants develop expectation for the onset of rhythmic cycles (the downbeat), even when it is not marked by stress or other distinguishing spectral features. Omitting the downbeat elicits brain activity associated with violating sensory expectations. Thus, our results strongly support the view that beat perception is innate.

    abstract = {The "ba, ba, ba" sound universal to babies' babbling around 7 months captures scientific attention because it provides insights into the mechanisms underlying language acquisition and vestiges of its evolutionary origins. Yet the prevailing mystery is what is the biological basis of babbling, with one hypothesis being that it is a non-linguistic motoric activity driven largely by the baby's emerging control over the mouth and jaw, and another being that it is a linguistic activity reflecting the babies' early sensitivity to specific phonetic-syllabic patterns. Two groups of hearing babies were studied over time (ages 6, 10, and 12 months), equal in all developmental respects except for the modality of language input (mouth versus hand): three hearing babies acquiring spoken language (group 1: "speech-exposed") and a rare group of three hearing babies acquiring sign language only, not speech (group 2: "sign-exposed"). Despite this latter group's exposure to sign, the motoric hypothesis would predict similar hand activity to that seen in speech-exposed hearing babies because language acquisition in sign-exposed babies does not involve the mouth. Using innovative quantitative Optotrak {3-D} motion-tracking technology, applied here for the first time to study infant language acquisition, we obtained physical measurements similar to a speech spectrogram, but for the hands. Here we discovered that the specific rhythmic frequencies of the hands of the sign-exposed hearing babies differed depending on whether they were producing linguistic activity, which they produced at a low frequency of approximately 1 Hz, versus non-linguistic activity, which they produced at a higher frequency of approximately 2.5 Hz - the identical class of hand activity that the speech-exposed hearing babies produced nearly exclusively. Surprisingly, without benefit of the mouth, hearing sign-exposed babies alone babbled systematically on their hands. We conclude that babbling is fundamentally a linguistic activity and explain why the differentiation between linguistic and non-linguistic hand activity in a single manual modality (one distinct from the human mouth) could only have resulted if all babies are born with a sensitivity to specific rhythmic patterns at the heart of human language and the capacity to use them.},

In particular, we attempted to shed new light on whether babies know that they are acquiring different lexicons right from the start, or whether early bilingual exposure causes them to be semantically confused. We propose a collection of research methods that, taken together, can answer these questions, which have hitherto received scant attention. Six hearing babies were videotaped for one hour on average seven times over one year (ages ranging from 0;7 to 2;2); three babies were acquiring French and English, and three French and {LSQ}. These populations offer unique insights into the semantic knowledge underlying bilingual as well as monolingual language acquisition. We found that the babies (1) acquired their two languages on the same timetable as monolinguals and (2) produced translation equivalents in their very first lexicons. Further, their early words (signs) in each language (3) were constrained along kind boundaries, (4) showed fundamentally similar semantic organization across their dual lexicons, and (5) reflected the meanings of their favorite things first. We also discuss why attributions that young bilinguals are delayed and confused have prevailed and we show that they are neither at this point in development. Finally, the present findings show how research of this type can provide a method for making bilingual norms wholly attainable.},

    abstract = {
                Throughout history and across cultures, humans have created music using pitch intervals that divide octaves into the 12 tones of the chromatic scale. Why these specific intervals in music are preferred, however, is not known. In the present study, we analyzed a database of individually spoken English vowel phones to examine the hypothesis that musical intervals arise from the relationships of the formants in speech spectra that determine the perceptions of distinct vowels. Expressed as ratios, the frequency relationships of the first two formants in vowel phones represent all 12 intervals of the chromatic scale. Were the formants to fall outside the ranges found in the human voice, their relationships would generate either a less complete or a more dilute representation of these specific intervals. These results imply that human preference for the intervals of the chromatic scale arises from experience with the way speech formants modulate laryngeal harmonics to create different phonemes.

Empericism has been invented and destroyed several times.  

Desiderata for concepts:

Scope - theory must accommodate all the concepts we are capable of
possessing, from sensory to abstract.

Intentional content - Intentionality here means that a concept refer
to something other than themselves, and intentional content is that to
which they refer.  theory should help us understand how concepts
attent their intentional contents.  There is disagreement about what
concepts refer to -- something in nature (realism), a group dependent
on human thoughts and practices, or a group decided upon by an
individual. Prinz presupposes strong realism "If reference is
determined merely by how I actually categorize, there could be no such
thing as error".

Cognitive content - Coreferential terms can seem different (Lewis
Carroll / Charles Dodgson), and concepts that are not coreferential
can seem alike (different things serving the same purpose in similar
situations).  Theory should allow for such cognitive content.

Acquisition - Theory should support explanation of how concepts are
acquired.

Categorisation - 

Compositionality - Novel concepts may be built from existing ones.

Publicity - Concepts must be capbable of being shared by different individuals and by one individual at different times.

Here we show that the way adults move their bodies to music influences their auditory perception of the rhythm structure. We trained adults, while listening to an ambiguous rhythm with no accented beats, to bounce by bending their knees to interpret the rhythm either as a march or as a waltz. At test, adults identified as similar an auditory version of the rhythm pattern with accented strong beats that matched their previous bouncing experience in comparison with a version whose accents did not match. In subsequent experiments we showed that this effect does not depend on visual information, but that movement of the body is critical. Parallel results from adults and infants suggest that the movement-sound interaction develops early and is fundamental to music processing throughout life.

Another well-known idea, often espoused as being in opposition to the first proposal, is that processing of speech sounds entails general-purpose neural mechanisms sensitive to the acoustic features that are present in speech. Here, we suggest that these dichotomous views need not be mutually exclusive. Specifically, there is now extensive evidence that spectral and temporal acoustical properties predict the relative specialization of right and left auditory cortices, and that this is a parsimonious way to account not only for the processing of speech sounds, but also for non-speech sounds such as musical tones. We also point out that there is equally compelling evidence that neural responses elicited by speech sounds can differ depending on more abstract, linguistically relevant properties of a stimulus (such as whether it forms part of one's language or not). Tonal languages provide a particularly valuable window to understand the interplay between these processes. The key to reconciling these phenomena probably lies in understanding the interactions between afferent pathways that carry stimulus information, with top-down processing mechanisms that modulate these processes. Although we are still far from the point of having a complete picture, we argue that moving forward will require us to abandon the dichotomy argument in favour of a more integrated approach.},

The 'metabolic hypothesis' assumes there is a causal link between how much energy the neurons need, in the form of glucose, and the subsequent regulation of blood flow in the brain. In other words, the neurons signal the need for energy, which is delivered later.

The 'neurogenic hypothesis' hypothesis, suggest that blood flow can be 'pre-ordered', in anticipation of neural activity.

Needless to say, it's important to understand the exact relation between the operation of the neurons and blood flow, because brain scanning studies typically measure blood flow to infer the working of neurons and hence the relationship to cognitive or mental processing.

The Frontiers in Human Neuroscience article is a concise piece which discuss the neuroscience of this link, and covers some of the most recent studies which have attempted to make sense of what brain scans tell us when we're doing psychology experiments.

    abstract = {Listening to speech recruits a network of fronto-temporo-parietal cortical areas. Classical models consider anterior (motor) sites to be involved in speech production whereas posterior sites are considered to be involved in comprehension. This functional segregation is challenged by action-perception theories suggesting that brain circuits for speech articulation and speech perception are functionally dependent. Although recent data show that speech listening elicits motor activities analogous to production, it's still debated whether motor circuits play a causal contribution to the perception of speech. Here we administered transcranial magnetic stimulation ({TMS}) to motor cortex controlling lips and tongue during the discrimination of lip- and tongue-articulated phonemes. We found a neurofunctional double dissociation in speech sound discrimination, supporting the idea that motor structures provide a specific functional contribution to the perception of speech sounds. Moreover, our findings show a fine-grained motor somatotopy for speech comprehension. We discuss our results in light of a modified "motor theory of speech perception" according to which speech comprehension is grounded in motor circuits not exclusively involved in speech production.},

    abstract = {The superior temporal sulcus ({STS}) is the chameleon of the human brain. Several research areas claim the {STS} as the host brain region for their particular behavior of interest. Some see it as one of the core structures for theory of mind. For others, it is the main region for audiovisual integration. It plays an important role in biological motion perception, but is also claimed to be essential for speech processing and processing of faces. We review the foci of activations in the {STS} from multiple functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, focusing on theory of mind, audiovisual integration, motion processing, speech processing, and face processing. The results indicate a differentiation of the {STS} region in an anterior portion, mainly involved in speech processing, and a posterior portion recruited by cognitive demands of all these different research areas. The latter finding argues against a strict functional subdivision of the {STS}. In line with anatomical evidence from tracer studies, we propose that the function of the {STS} varies depending on the nature of network coactivations with different regions in the frontal cortex and medial-temporal lobe. This view is more in keeping with the notion that the same brain region can support different cognitive operations depending on task-dependent network connections, emphasizing the role of network connectivity analysis in neuroimaging.},

Surprisingly, however, the question as to whether such patients can imagine new experiences has not been formally addressed to our knowledge. We tested whether a group of amnesic patients with primary damage to the hippocampus bilaterally could construct new imagined experiences in response to short verbal cues that outlined a range of simple commonplace scenarios. Our results revealed that patients were markedly impaired relative to matched control subjects at imagining new experiences. Moreover, we identified a possible source for this deficit. The patients' imagined experiences lacked spatial coherence, consisting instead of fragmented images in the absence of a holistic representation of the environmental setting. The hippocampus, therefore, may make a critical contribution to the creation of new experiences by providing the spatial context into which the disparate elements of an experience can be bound. Given how closely imagined experiences match episodic memories, the absence of this function mediated by the hippocampus, may also fundamentally affect the ability to vividly re-experience the past.},

Our approach is to identify and segment groups of signals in individual modalities (sight, hearing, and proprioception) based on their rhythmic variation, then to identify and bind causally-related groups of signals across different modalities. By including proprioception as a modality, this cross-modal binding method applies to the robot itself, and we report a series of experiments in which the robot learns about the characteristics of its own body.},

We equipped the humanoid robot with an initial set of motor and perceptual competencies ranging from simple stereotyped actions to more sophisticated visual routines providing a bottom-up attention system. This initial form of sensorimotor coordination is sufficient to initiate the interaction with the environment and allows the robot to improve its motor and perceptual skills by first constructing a "body-schema" and later by learning about objects. The body-schema allows controlling movements to fixate, reach and touch objects in the environment. The interaction is further used to form a visual model of the objects grasped by the robot which eventually modulate the attention system in a top-down way. In another experiment we show an initial effort to study the acquisition of object affordances. We discuss the importance of sensorimotor coordination as a required step not only for the control of action but also, and more importantly, for perceptual development},

We show that these correlations often exceed what is statistically possible assuming the (evidently rather limited) reliability of both {fMRI} and personality/emotion measures. The implausibly high correlations are all the more puzzling because social-neuroscience method sections rarely contain sufficient detail to ascertain how these correlations were obtained. We surveyed authors of 54 articles that reported findings of this kind to determine the details of their analyses. More than half acknowledged using a strategy that computes separate correlations for individual voxels, and reports means of just the subset of voxels exceeding chosen thresholds. We show how this non-independent analysis grossly inflates correlations, while yielding reassuring-looking scattergrams. This analysis technique was used to obtain the vast majority of the implausibly high correlations in our survey sample. In addition, we argue that other analysis problems likely created entirely spurious correlations in some cases. We outline how the data from these studies could be reanalyzed with unbiased methods to provide the field with accurate estimates of the correlations in question.

    comment = {A critical yet sympathetic review of the mirror neuron theory of action understanding.

The data: Mirror neurons first discovered in frontal area F5 of the macaque monkey.  The cells activated when the monkey observed goal directed actions (hand and/or mouth movements directed towards objects), but not to visually presented objects, faces, non-goal-directed body movenemtns, goal-directed actions made using tools, mimicking of grasping an absent object, or movement preparation activity.  Further, no M1 cells (hand area of primary motor cortex) during action observation.  On this basis, mirror neurons were hypothesized to suppose action understanding.  The cells were later also discovered in monkey parietal cortex and M1.


Theory: Mirror neurons support action understanding, whereas most (nonmirror) neurons in macaque F5 support a motor vocabulary.  The definition of "action understanding" seems to be evolving, "at its core is the idea that self-generated action shave an inherent semantics and that observing the same action in others affords access to this action semantics."  Mirror neurons are inferred to exist in humans, but evidence is problematic, not according with observations of the original macaque study.  Analogies have been drawn to motor theory of speech perception, but this theory is not currently supported in the field of speech perception.  Mirror neurons have been used to explain human imitation, but macaques cannot imitate.  

Focuses on the claim that mirror neurons go beyond other sensory-motor cells in F5 and support action understanding, finding 8 problems:

== There Is No Evidence in Monkeys That Mirror Neurons Support Action Understanding ==

Lesions to F5 have been shown to disrupt grasping behaviour, but not action understanding.  Other experimental methods are problematic and with simpler alternative explanations.  

== Action understanding can be achieved via nonmirror neuron mechanisms ==

Rizzolatti et al papers explicitly do not exclude the possibility that other areas are involved in action understanding.  Hickok proposes one alternative, STS representing actions, and PF coordinating their interaction with the motor system in P5.

== M1 contains mirror neurons ==

The lack of mirror neurons in M1 was taken as evidence against covert generation of movement responses during action perception.  Now mirror neurons have been found in M1 it is possible that "mirror" responses are simply the facilitation of the motor system via learned association.

== The relation between macaque mirror neurons and the mirror system in humans is either nonparallel or undetermined ==

Macaques do not show behaviours that have been attributed to mirror neurons in humans, and the existence of mirror neurons in humans has not been conclusively proven.  The assumption that humans have evolved in such a way as to preserve action understanding properties of mirror neurons, but with the adaptation of also supporting imitation (as human data appears to show) is a bold one, and other possibilities are not considered.

== Action understanding in humans dissociates from neurophysiological indices of the human mirror system ==

== Action understanding and action production dissociate ==

== Damage to the inferior frontal gryus is not correlated with action understanding deficits ==

== Generalization of hte mirror system to speech recognition fails on empirical grounds == 

"... lesion studies unequivocally demonstrate that the motor theory/mirron neuron theory of speech perception is incorrect in any strong form."  A weaker form - that sensory-motor circuits do contribute to speech recognition, but in a modulatory, top-down fashion rather than being primary.

Cites alternative roles for mirror neurons as simple sensory-motor pairings, and as a mechanism for augmenting abstract concepts with sensory-motor data.},

However, this seeming correspondence is superficial, and there are theoretical and empirical reasons to temper enthusiasm about the explanatory role mirror neurons might have for speech perception. In fact, rather than providing support for {MT}, mirror neurons are actually inconsistent with the central tenets of {MT}.},

    comment = {Points out that mirror system and motor theory of speech production are contradictory, in that MT characterises a module specialised for speech and nothing else, whereas mirror system is general.  Speech is only special in the former.

Broca's aphasics leave subjects with severe motor speech deficits yet speech recognition is left intact.  Indeed the entire left hemisphere 'mirror system' can be affected with speech recognition intact.  Neither MT or mirror neurons explain this.  Mixed transcortical aphasia is characterized by a severe deficit in speech comprehension despite a well-preserved ability to repeat heard speech.

Paper does not challenge that there is a production-perception link, but takes the opposite view to MT -- that production is aided by perception rather than vice-versa.  Example of bite-block in mouth in support of this view -- motor articulations change in order to preserve the same sound (perception).

Finishes by recounting the many open questions about speech perception and pointing out that a mirror system isn't a solution to them.

    comment = {Despite the directionality given in the title, this review talks about 'meshing' of action and perception, which I suppose is two-way.

Says speech perception field is critical of motor theory of speech perception, but comes out in favour of many of its claims.  More favourable than Lotto et al, who later point out that this review does not mention Broca's aphasia.

Cites original motivation for motor theory from device for the blind which sonified letters with arbitrary sounds, but was unexpectedly unsuccessful.  Led to discovery of coarticulation.

Three strong claims of MT:

Speech processing is special - Interpretable in several different ways, no good supporting evidence for any of them.

Perceiving speech is perceiving gestures - Supported by several kinds of evidence: 1/ identical stimuli are perceived differently depending on the context of coarticulation. 2/ Cross-modal effects, ie McGurk effect.  3/ Speech imitation is very fast, indicating choice isn't involved.  4/ Listeners situate the acoustic signal in a space that captures its gestural causes.  Alternative accounts, such as spectral contrast and prototype context effects, don't cover all of these points.

The motor system is recruited for perceiving speech - The 'core claim' of the theory.  Not much research into behavioural evidence for a perception-production link, although what exists does support it.  The claim is backed by research into evolution - production and and perception systems must co-evolve, because motor systems provide parity for perception systems.  Reviews research into motor competence (in general, not specifically in speech) giving reason to believe that perception is attuned to general anatomical and dynamical constraints on biological movements, as well as to the specific subtleties of individual movements.  Reviews evidence of a mirror system.  Evidence specifically about speech includes overlap shown by fMRI, activation of tongue muscles when hearing lingual consonants and of lip muscles when lip reading.  Also reviews research into canonical neurons, which activate both when grasping an object and seeing an object that can be grasped in that manner, giving reason to believe that this theory of action execution and recognition may be extended to the domain of general perception of objects.

"The main lesson learned by Liberman and colleagues in 50 years of empirical research is, in the end, rather simple: Cognition, like all products of evolution, cannot be understood in isolation (e.g., Clark, 1997). Rather, understanding cognition requires comprehending that it is both embedded in a meaningful ecological context and embodied in living perception–action systems".

Music has a unique ability to trigger memories, awaken emotions and to intensify our social experiences. We do not need to be trained in music performance or appreciation to be able to reap its benefits-already as infants, we relate to it spontaneously and effortlessly. There has been a recent surge in neuroimaging investigations of the neural basis of musical experience, but the way in which the abstract shapes and patterns of musical sound can have such profound meaning to us remains elusive. Here we review recent neuroimaging evidence and suggest that music, like language, involves an intimate coupling between the perception and production of hierarchically organized sequential information, the structure of which has the ability to communicate meaning and emotion. We propose that these aspects of musical experience may be mediated by the human mirror neuron system.},

An interesting set of timbre descriptors commonly used by guitarists seem to refer to phonetic gestures: thin, nasal, round, open, etc. The magnitude spectrum of guitar tones being comb-filter shaped, we propose to see the local maxima of that comb filter structure as vocal formants. When guitarists talk about a guitar sound as being round, it would mean that it sounds like a round-shaped-mouth sound, such as the vowel /O/. Although the acoustic systems of the guitar and of the voice mechanism are structurally different, we highlight the fact that guitar tones and a particular set of vowels display similar formant regions.

    comment = {In direct opposition to Patel, sees language and music as distinct, where any shared aspects are instances of more general capacities.

Lists seven commonalities between language and music, fine scale voluntary vocal production, large scale memory, combinatoriality, expectation, imitation, innovation and joint action.  The first is unnecessary for music (ie, instruments) and language (ie, signed languages).

Language conveys propositional thought, and music enhances affect (term preferred by Jackendoff over emotion).  "Language is essentially a mapping between sound and "propositional" or "conceptual" thought".  Points out that language can be translated and music can't (Patel also does).

Claims all music is for the "enhancement of affect associated with an activity".  If this is meaning, then fine but it has little or no relation to linguistic meaning.

There's no counterpart to subliminal music in language.

Language /can/ be put to affective use, but music can't be put to propositional use.

Sees poetry etc as a music/language hybrid.

Language and music both convey affect through tone of voice, but Jackendoff sees this as evidence that both have incorporated in different ways some of the character of Mammalian call systems.  So, a common root, but not an evolved single capacity that later split.

Otherwise sees specialization of language to conceptual information and music to affect as extreme.

Rhythm - concludes the metrical grid may be unique to language and music, musical grouping is shared more with vision than with language, and linguistic intonation contours are 'partly specific' to language.

Pitch - no convincing ananalogue in language to the musical use of pitch space, despite their making use of the same vocal motor capacities.

Words - no analogue beyond cliched sequences.  (doesn't mention vocables)

Syntax - No analogue in music.

GTTM Prolongational structure - closest counterpart to syntax, but concerned with tensing/relaxation rather than conceptual relations.

Complex action - Jackendoff07 says complex actions (shaking hands/making coffee) invokes eaborate hierarchical structure, sharing features both with syntactic and prolongational trees.  Proposes the complex action is a older function appropriated by both language and music, possibly independently.  [what about structure behind building up a picture from looking around a room, cf martin sereno]

In final conclusion, little indication of shared characteristics beyond the domain general.  Sign language highlights this.  Language and music differ substantially in rhythmic structure, use of pitch, in their 'meaning' (propositional vs affective), and form and function of their hierarchical structures.

Attempts at drawing connections are valid, eg Patel reviews same evidence and concludes glass is half full.  But we should include other capacities in comparisons.

[I suppose this is an argument against the integration of language and music, but not agains the integration of a larger number of modalities, of which these two are a subset]

    abstract = {We investigated grapheme-colour synaesthesia and found that (1) The induced colours led to perceptual grouping and pop-out, (2) a number rendered invisible through \&\#039;crowding\&\#039; or lateral masking can induce synaesthetic colours -- a form of blindsight -- and (3) peripherally presented graphemes did not induce colours even when they were clearly visible. Taken collectively, these and other experiments prove conclusively that synaesthesia is a genuine perceptual phenomenon, not an effect based on memory associations from childhood or on vague metaphorical speech. We identify different subtypes of number-colour synaesthesia and propose that they are caused by hyperconnectivity between colour and number areas at different stages in processing; lower synaesthetes may have cross-wiring (or cross-activation) within the fusiform gyrus whereas higher synaesthetes may have cross-activation in the angular gyrus. This hyperconnectivity might be caused by a genetic mutation that causes defective pruning of connections between brain maps. The mutation may further be expressed selectively (due to transcription factors) in the fusiform or angular gyri, and this may explain the existence of different forms of synaesthesia. If expressed very diffusely, there may be extensive cross-wiring between brain regions that represent abstract concepts, which would explain the link between creativity, metaphor and synaesthesia (and the higher incidence of synaesthesia among artists and poets). Also, hyperconnectivity between the sensory cortex and amygdala would explain the heightened aversion synaesthetes experience when seeing numbers printed in the \&\#039;wrong\&\#039; colour. Lastly, kindling -- induced hyperconnectivity in the temporal lobes of temporal lobe epilepsy ({TLE}) patients -- may explain the purported higher incidence of synaesthesia in these patients. We conclude with a synaesthesia-based theory of the evolution of language. Thus, our experiments on synaesthesia and our theoretical framework attempt to link several seemingly unrelated facts about the human mind. Far from being a mere curiosity, synaesthesia may provide a window into perception, thought and language.},

    abstract = {With ever increasing amounts of visual information to take in when interacting with computers, users can become overloaded. One reason is that computers communicate solely by graphical output. This paper suggests the use of non-speech sound output to enhance the graphical display of information to overcome overload. The question is how to integrate the display of sound and graphics to capitalise on the advantages each offers. The approach described here is to integrate sound into the basic components of the human-computer interface. Two experiments are described where non-speech sounds were added to buttons and scrollbars. Results showed sound improved usability by increasing performance and reducing time to recover from errors. Subjective workload measures also showed a significant reduction. Results from this work show that the integrated display of graphical and auditory information can overcome information overload. {\copyright} 1997 Elsevier Science {B.V}.},

@book{Leman07,
    abstract = {{Digital media handles music as encoded physical energy, but humans consider music in terms of beliefs, intentions, interpretations, experiences, evaluations, and significations. In this book, drawing on work in computer science, psychology, brain science, and musicology, Marc Leman proposes an embodied cognition approach to music research that will help bridge this gap. Assuming that the body plays a central role in all musical activities, and basing his approach on a hypothesis about the relationship between musical experience (mind) and sound energy (matter), Leman proposes that the human body is a biologically designed mediator that transfers physical energy to a mental level--engaging experiences, values, and intentions--and, reversing the process, transfers mental representation into material form. He suggests that this idea of the body as mediator offers a promising framework for thinking about music mediation technology. Leman argues that, under certain conditions, the natural mediator (the body) can be extended with artificial technology-based mediators. He explores the necessary conditions and analyzes ways in which they can be studied.<br /> <br /> Leman outlines his theory of embodied music cognition, introducing a model that describes the relationship between a human subject and its environment, analyzing the coupling of action and perception, and exploring different degrees of the body's engagement with music. He then examines possible applications in two core areas: interaction with music instruments and music search and retrieval in a database or digital library. The embodied music cognition approach, Leman argues, can help us develop tools that integrate artistic expression and contemporary technology.}},

Organization of elements was indexed by several single-mode tests of auditory form perception to verify the perceptual segregation of either an individual formant of a synthetic word or a tonal component of a sinusoidal word analogue. Organization of patterned variation was indexed by a test of lexical identification.

@article{Lahav07,
    abstract = {The discovery of audiovisual mirror neurons in monkeys gave rise to the hypothesis that premotor areas are inherently involved not only when observing actions but also when listening to action-related sound. However, the whole-brain functional formation underlying such "action-listening" is not fully understood. In addition, previous studies in humans have focused mostly on relatively simple and overexperienced everyday actions, such as hand clapping or door knocking. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to ask whether the human action-recognition system responds to sounds found in a more complex sequence of newly acquired actions. To address this, we chose a piece of music as a model set of acoustically presentable actions and trained non-musicians to play it by ear. We then monitored brain activity in subjects while they listened to the newly acquired piece. Although subjects listened to the music without performing any movements, activation was found bilaterally in the frontoparietal motor-related network (including Broca's area, the premotor region, the intraparietal sulcus, and the inferior parietal region), consistent with neural circuits that have been associated with action observations, and may constitute the human mirror neuron system. Presentation of the practiced notes in a different order activated the network to a much lesser degree, whereas listening to an equally familiar but motorically unknown music did not activate this network. These findings support the hypothesis of a "hearing-doing" system that is highly dependent on the individual's motor repertoire, gets established rapidly, and consists of Broca's area as its hub.},

We predicted that the basal ganglia and supplementary motor area ({SMA}) would respond in the presence of a regular beat. To establish what rhythm properties induce a beat, we asked subjects to reproduce different types of rhythmic sequences. Improved reproduction was observed for one rhythm type, which had integer ratio relationships between its intervals and regular perceptual accents. A subsequent functional magnetic resonance imaging study found that these rhythms also elicited higher activity in the basal ganglia and {SMA}. This finding was consistent across different levels of musical training, although musicians showed activation increases unrelated to rhythm type in the premotor cortex, cerebellum, and {SMAs} ({pre-SMA} and {SMA}).

A new set-theoretical approach to similarity is developed in which objects are represented as collections of features and similarity is described as a feature-matching process. Specifically, a set of qualitative assumptions is shown to imply the contrast model, which expresses the similarity between objects as a linear combination of the measures of their common and distinctive features. Several predictions of the contrast model are tested in studies of similarity with both semantic and perceptual stimuli. The model is used to uncover, analyze, and explain a variety of empirical phenomena such as the role of common and distinctive features, the relations between judgments of similarity and difference, the presence of asymmetric similarities, and the effects of context on judgments of similarity. The contrast model generalizes standard representations of similarity data in terms of clusters and trees. It is also used to analyze the relations of prototypicality and family resemblance.},

Features of similarity

Many authors argue that dimensional representations are appropriate
for certain domains (e.g. colours, tones) but not others.  It seems
more appropriate to represent faces, countries or personalities, in
terms of many qualitative features that a few quantitative dimensions.
Similarity for such stimuli is therefore comparison of features rather
than metric distance.

(thought - gardenfors considers dimensions both qualititative and
quantitative).

Evaluates geometric approach to similarity in terms of minimality,
symmetry and triangle inequality axioms.  These axioms are often
violated by similarity measures.

Minimality: similarity with identity being equal for all stimuli does
not always hold.  For example in some experiments the probability of
judging two identical stimuli as "same" rather than "different" is not
constant for all stimuli, and an object may be identified as another
more often than itself.

[Noise and a prototype effects?]

Symmetry: similarity statements are often directional, e.g. a portrait
is more like a person, an ellipse is more like a circle, and north
korea is more like red china than the other way around.  Asymmetry is
noticeable in metaphor: turks fight like tigers, but tigers don't
fight like turks.

[A prototype effect?]

Triangle inequality: unlike minimality and symmetry, cannot be
formulated in ordinal terms, so can't be refuted with ordinal data.
However it implies that if a and b, and b and c are quite similar, a
and c can't be very different.  However Jamaica is similar to Cuba
(geographically), and cuba is similar to russia (politically) but
Jamaica is not at all like Russia.

[A domain effect]

In summary: minimality is problematic, symmetry is false and triangle
inequality is not compelling.

Proposes the "contrast model" as an alternative approach neither
dimensional or metric, but based on features which are usually binary
(e.g voiced vs voiceless consonants) or nominal (e.g. eye colour).

Similarity increases with addition of common features / deletion of
distinctive features.  

Results in an interval similarity scale preserving observed similarity
order, and expressed as a linear combination or contrast of the
measures of the common and distinctive features.

Does not define a single similarity scale, but a family of scales
differing according to the consideration given to common and distinct
features, and to directionality.  Thus tree based similarity scales
are possible as well as more geometrical ones.  

Examines similarity of figures, letters and signals on this basis.

Similarity, prototypicality and family resemblance are formally
accounted for in the model.

"There is a close tie between the assessment of similarity and the
interpretation of metaphors.  In judgments of similarity one assumes a
particular feature space, or a frame of reference, and assesses the
quality of the match between the subject and the referent.  In the
interpretation of similies, one assumes a resemblance between the
subject and the referent and searches for an interpretation of the
space that would maximizt the quality of the match.  The same pair of
objects, therefore, can be viewed as similar or different depending on
the choice of a frame of reference."

[Maybe Gardenfors' theory can be expressed in terms of Tversky's.
Although Tversky seems against geometry here, I think a geometrical
theory is a valid configuration of his contrast model.]

The persuasive argument I have to try to counter: "Any kind of automatic stroke classification is a layer of abstraction that reduces control intimacy."

Nice thought experiment: "what would it take to make a physically modeled hand drum with control intimacy equal to the real thing?"

Doesn't cite Laird, \_might\_ have some prior art there on some minor points, for example Laird doesn't use ideal impulses.

Hasn't mentioned touch feedback yet, seems important for intimacy

Cheap sensor, seems to need fairly expensive external sound card though

Lovely resonance field (Chladni) patterns shown on page 72

Has problems worked around with auto callibration.

Very nice in-depth discussion of implementation and behaviour of a waveguide mesh, for example "Since the mesh is excited with the derivative of force from the sensor at each node, energy is added to the mesh (but in the up direction) when a hand is quickly pulled away. This adds a subtle ringing that increases the physical plausbility of the overall sound."

Evaluation is short and anecdotal.  Laments getting obsessed with technical correctness. "as physical metaphors get more literal, they get more creatively limiting"

Each subject was run in three or four sessions of 351 trials each. The tones had structures like those of musical instruments, being made of all 27 combinations of three dimensions, each at three levels. In Experiment 1, the dimensions were fundamental frequency F0, envelope, and relative amplitudes of harmonics. In Experiment 2, the dimensions were number of harmonics, envelope, and onset rate of harmonics. Analysis of data by means of multidimensional scaling showed a strong context effect. In Experiment 1, F0 had such high saliency that for most subjects no other dimension was present in perceptual space and thus no differences were found between musical and nonmusical subjects. By holding F0 constant in Experiment 2, subjects were able to use harmonic as well as envelope structure in judgments. Differences between musical and nonmusical subjects appeared, and we discuss the basis for these differences. For both experiments, the curve relating latency of response to similarity was parabolic and, although a given subject's perceptual space changes little over successive runs, there is some evidence from Experiment 2 that musical subjects have the more stable space of perceptual {dimensions.Subject} Classification: 65.52, 65.75; 75.10. doi:10.1121/1.380719 {PACS}: 43.65.+v, 43.75.+a Additional Information Full Text:  [  {PDF} (874 {kB})   {GZipped} {PS}},

    comment = {Critical review of timbre research

Sees lack of "widely-accepted operational or constitutive definition of timbre" as the most lasting obstacle to a better understanding of timbre.

Notes according to "just noticable differences" (JND) the average person can detence 15000 distinct pitches and 325 levels of loudness, but the answer for timbre is unknown due to its multidimensionality.

== Methods for measuring musical timbre ==

Identification - identifying instruments

Categorisation - grouping of comparison stimuli with the members of a set of standard stimuli.  Similar to identification but without requiring verbalisation

Matching - Subjective pairing of a single comparison stimulus to a single model

Verbal attributes - forced projection of an adjectival (or adverbial) schema onto a specified set of sounds, e.g. scaling stimuli on a  "brighter" or "duller" scale.

Proximity rating - e.g. MDS studies.  Similarity scaling and triadic comparisons suitable for 8 < n < 25 stimuli.   Sorting has not been used much in timbre studies but is useful for stimulus sets of 50 or even 100 elements.  

Discrimination - e.g. Grey's AAAB procedure with task to find different tone in set of four

== Discussion ==

Only discrimination tasks can uncover minute differences in timbre between stimuli, which are the norm in psychophysical studies.  Difficult to obtain clean stimuli in recordings of natural tones, so contrived synthetic tone studies are difficult to repeat under more 'natural' circumstances.

== Equalisation of pitch, loudness and duration ==

Clear that there are individual differences in perception of pitch, loudness and duration so attempts at equalisation are necessarily approximate.
Unknown to what extent pitch, loudness and duration are confounders in timbre studies.  For pitch, in some studies (Miller and Carterett, 1975), fundamental frequency has been shown to have high saliency making timbre difficult to map, and in others (Robinson and Patterson (1995)) where stimuli is very short (a few cycles) instrument type is easier to identify than pitch chroma or octave.  

The confounding effects of loudness have not been formally studied, but as perceptual loudness clearly varies per listener, and timbral similarity judgments between listeners is high, it is not felt to be a major confounder.  

Confounding effects of duration (perceived length) has not been formally studied either.  It is felt that slight deviations are not confounders, but salience increases with staccato and impulse tones.

== Perceptual and physical correlates ==

Two explanations for subjective identification of timbre, 'source' and 'interpretative'.  Source -- we perceive "underlying dynamics of physical processes" (balzano, 1986) analogous to motor theory of speech perception.  McAdams uses term from ecological psychology - "structural invariants" since they are based upon the physical structure of the vibrating system and its excitation.  Interpretative is the traditional view, that timbre is due to the input from realtime frequency analysis conducted along the basilar membrane of the inner ear.  

"We feel that the source and interpretative modes of perception contribute uniquely to identifications and timbral relationships.  Indeed, both phyisical modelling and signal analysis are effective bases for the synthesis of natural instruments.  But the relationship of the constituents of physical models to perceptual attributes has not been widely pursued."  OTOH there's a great deal of research into the envelope and time-varying spectrum relative to timbre.

So they think both contribute to timbre, but only interpretative models have really been investigated.

Studies so far find disagreement when not based upon the same set of stimuli.  The only common factor found is the spectral centroid (brightness).

    comment = {MDS study of timbre space dimensions using synthetic tones.

Uses ANSI (1973) definition of timbre as "the perceptual attribute that distinguishes to tones of equal pitch, loudness and duration).  

Mentions reviews of timbre space studies - those based on ratings on verbal scales (kendall and carterette 1993), and on MDS (mcadams 1993, hajda et al 1997).

Compares the CLASCAL and INDSCAL models of MDS.  They both produce solutions with axes oriented in a psychologically meaningful way.  In CLASCAL the salience of each dimension is different for each latent class of subjects, and in INDSCAL different for each subject.  In the latent class approach, each subject is assumed to belong to one and only one of a small number of latent classes, and all subjects in the same class are assumed to weight all dimensions identically.  It is not known in advance to which altent class a particular subject belongs.

CONSCAL is more recent (windsberg and de soete 1997), useful where a small number of known physical parameters may be used to describe the stimuli, and it is likely that these are the very attributes upon which the subjects make their dissimilarity ratings.  The resulting MDS is constrained by the given dimensions.

MDS studies generally either use orchestral sounds or synthetic sounds constructed to imitate them.  Most studies hav eemphasized the role of spectral center of gravity (SCG, amplitude-weighted mean frequency of the energy spectrum) and attack time.  Other less systematically reported parameters include spectral flux (a mesaure of the fluctuation of the spectrum over time), spectral spread, spectral irregularity and harmonic onset asynchrony.  Along with these shared dimensions, a number of instruments are characterized by rather high specificity values, which have often been difficult to interpret.

This paper deals with two questions: (1) is a continuous space a good model of the perceptual relationships among timbres (2) if such a model is appropriate, are the proposed underlying acoustical dimensions correct?

This confirmatory study took parameters from previous MDS studies of timbre.  There were 16 different values along each acoustical dimension 'to avoid creating unwanted categories'.  The first experiment tested a space with dimensions of attack time, spectral centroid and spectral flux.  Experiment 2 investigated contextual effects on the salience of spectral flux.  Finally a space with attack time, spectral centroid and spectral irregularity was tested.

CLASCAL analyses was applied to select freely the most salient acoustical parameters.  CONSCAL was applied to allow for more refined interpretation, with an estimation of the shape of psychophysical functions for the different axes.  CONSCAL had been used only once before in the context of timbre (mcadams and winsberg 2000).

Experiment 1 - CLASCAL identified a 2D space correlated with SCG and attack time, but not with spectral flux.  The subjects were classified into two classes, both containing musically trained subjects.  CONSCAL selected a model with one class of subjects and orthogonal dimensions.  

The data confirm the perceptual significance of attack time and SCG, and that listeners use a continuous range of attack times in their ratings.  CLASCAL finds listeners do not use spectral flux, whereas CONSCAL finds they do but only with sounds with the highest spectral flux values, and with a much smaller weighting than SCG and attack time.  These results are consistent with the subjects' subjective reports.

A resulting hypothesis was that spectral flux salience might be sensitive to contextual effects, particularly to the number of other dimensions varying concurrently.

Experiment 2

Isolated contextual effects by choosing three sets of stimuli: A - SCG kept constant, B - attack time kept constant and C - both SCG and attack time kept constant.

Confirmed the significance of attack time and SCG.  Spectral flux information was used to a larger extent when variation only ocurred along one concurrent dimension instead of two, and was more strongly inhibited by attack time than by SCG.  Hypothesis confirmed.

Experiment 3

Looked for third dimension of timbre salient enough to be used in dissimilarity ratings when both attack time and SCG vary.  Spectral flux dimension was replaced by a selective attenuation of even harmonics relative to odd harmonics.

Again, SCG and attack time confirmed as salient.  Spectral irregularity was also confirmed as a salient parameter.  All three appear to have the same perceptual status along a continuous scale.

== General discussion ==

Confirmed attack time, spectral centroid, spectral flux and attenuation of even harmonics explained timbre space dimensions, although spectral flux was hardly used when attack time and SCG varied concurrently.

Logarithm of attack time (not linear attack time) used in ratings.

Spectral centroid seems to be ordered on a linear frequency scale.

Attennuation in dB of even harmonics was used linearly in ratings.

Both CONSCAL and CLASCAL appear adequate to model dissimilarity ratings.

Inter-individual differences exist, whether these differences reflect different in decision or perception is an open question.

But music's tendency to deconstruct itself combined with thecomplexities of postmodernism doom him to failure. This is the parable thatframes "The Sense of Music," a novel treatment of music theory thatreinterprets the modern history of Western music in the terms of {semiotics.Based} on the assumption that music cannot be described without reference toits meaning, Raymond Monelle proposes that works of the Western classicaltradition be analyzed in terms of temporality, subjectivity, and topic {theory.Critical} of the abstract analysis of musical scores, Monelle argues that thescore does not reveal music's "sense." That sense--what a piece of music saysand signifies--can be understood only with reference to history, culture, andthe other arts. Thus, music is meaningful in that it signifies culturaltemporalities and themes, from the traditional manly heroism of the hunt tomilitary power to postmodern "polyvocality." This theoretical innovationallows Monelle to describe how the Classical style of the eighteenth century--which he reads as a balance of lyric and progressive time--gave way to {theRomantic} need for emotional realism. He argues that irony and ambiguitysubsequently eroded the domination of personal emotion in Western music aswell as literature, killing the composer's subjectivity with that of theauthor.

@article{Honorof05,
    abstract = {Fundamental frequency (F0) is used for many purposes in speech, but its linguistic significance is based on its relation to the speaker's range, not its absolute value. While it may be that listeners can gauge a specific pitch relative to a speaker's range by recognizing it from experience, whether they can do the same for an unfamiliar voice is an open question. The present experiment explored that question. Twenty native speakers of English (10 male, 10 female) produced the vowel /a/ with a spoken (not sung) voice quality at varying pitches within their own ranges. Listeners then judged, without familiarization or context, where each isolated F0 lay within each speaker's range. Correlations were high both for the entire range (0.721) and for the range minus the extremes (0.609). Correlations were somewhat higher when the F0s were related to the range of all the speakers, either separated by sex (0.830) or pooled (0.848), but several factors discussed here may help account for this pattern. Regardless, the present data provide strong support for the hypothesis that listeners are able to locate an F0 reliably within a range without external context or prior exposure to a speaker's voice.},

    abstract = {The book provides a comprehensive treatment of multidimensional scaling ({MDS}),
a family of statistical techniques for analyzing the structure of
(dis)similarity data. Such data are widespread, including, for example,
intercorrelations of survey items, direct ratings on the similarity on choice
objects, or trade indices for a set of countries. {MDS} represents the data as
distances among points in a geometric space of low dimensionality. This map
can help to see patterns in the data that are not obvious from the data
matrices. {MDS} is also used as a psychological model for judgments of
similarity and preference.

This book may be used as an introduction to {MDS} for students in psychology,
sociology, and marketing. The prerequisite is an elementary background in
statistics. The book is also well suited for a variety of advanced courses on
{MDS} topics. All the mathematics required for more advanced topics is developed
systematically.

This second edition is not only a complete overhaul of its predecessor, but
also adds some 140 pages of new material. Many chapters are revised or have
sections reflecting new insights and developments in {MDS}. There are two new
chapters, one on asymmetric models and the other on unfolding. There are also
numerous exercises that help the reader to practice what he or she has
learned, and to delve deeper into the models and its intricacies. These
exercises make it easier to use this edition in a course. All data sets used
in the book can be downloaded from the web. The appendix on computer programs
has also been updated and enlarged to reflect the state of the art.},

    comment = {Modern multi-dimensional scaling

Four purposes

a) method that represents (dis)similarity data as distances in a low
dimensional space in order to make these data accessible to visual
inspection and exploration

Allows researcher to *see* structure in the data


b) technique that allows one to test if and how certain criteria by
which one can distinguish among different objects of interest are
mirrored in corresponding empirical differences of these objects

... what one wants to know is if and how the facets (dimensions,
factors, features, etc.) by which the items are conceptually
distinguished are reflected in corresponding differences among
observations on these items.

c) data-analytic approach that allows one to discover the dimensions
that underlie judgments of (dis)similarity

d) psychological model that explains judgments of dissimilarity in
terms of a rule that mimics a particular type of distance function.

... involves a particular distance function that is defined on
particular dimensions and is interpreted quite literally as a
psychological composition rule.


Metrical vs Ordinal MDS

Usually result in similar maps.  Ordinal MDS useful where test
subjects rank data ordinally rather than differentiating metrically.


Measures of fit

Badness of fit measure known as loss function

raw Stress = sum-of-squares of errors between pairs.

Stress = normed raw Stress (avoids scale dependency, so disimilarities
meters do not have greater stress than those in kilometres).

Stress similar to a correlation coefficient, except that it measures
the badness-of-fit rather than the goodness-of-fit.

General term for similarity and dissimilarity is proximity.

Shepard diagram of Stress - proximities vs MDS distances.  Givesnumber
of points to be fitted, optimal regression line, size of deviations,
possible outliers and systematic deviations from the requested
deviation line.  Particularly informative for ordinal MDS.

Stress (or fit) per point table allows identification of best and
worse points.

Norms for Stress (in context of ordinal MDS): 
Guttman (in Porrat, 1974) proposes coefficient of alienation K should
be less that 0.15 for an acceptably precise MDS solution "under usual
circumstances".

Scree plot - Stress vs dimensionality.  'Elbow' in the curve
corresponds to the dimensionality that should be chosen.

For Stress-1 coefficient using ordinal MDS, Kruskal (1964a) suggests
benchmarks: 0.2 = poor, 0.1 = fair, 0.05 = good, 0.025 = excellent, 0
= perfect.  However these benchmarks lead to misuse - an MDS solution
may have high Stress simply as a consequence of high error in the
data, and finding a precise representation for the data does not imply
anything about its scientific value.


Dependencies of Stress:

- n, number of points - high n = higher stress
- m, dimensionality of MDS space: higher m = lower Stress
- more error in data means higher Stre
- more ties in the data allow for loewr Stress in general (for ordinal
  MDS with weak monotonicity)
- more missing data lead to lower Stress in general
- interval MDS generally leads to higher Stress than ordinal

Stress is a "technical measure" and should be tempered by
corresponding dimensions with prior knowledge or theory about the
scaled objects.


Collecting proximities

Anchor stimulus method, yielding conditional data - Hamish's chosen
one.  Task is easier and yields more reliable data.  However they
require more judgments overall and are 'less comparable'.  Bijmolt and
Wedel found that free collecting condition data was considered boring
and fatiguing by the respondants.  Pairwise copmarisons ranked best
for quality of data and MDS solution, followed by free sorting.

Balancing

Position effect can be reduced by randomly picking order, and timing
effects by picking a random order for the object pairs.  An
alternative is to balance position and timing effects by explicit
planning.  Ross (1934) developed a method for that purpose, superior
to random method if the number of objects is small.  A computer
program for Ross ordering was written by Cohen and Davison (1973).


Planned Incomplete Data Designs

Even if we randomly remove 80\% of the data, excellent recovery of MDS
space is still possible (Spence and Domoney, 1974).  Graef and Spence
(1979) showed configurations are poorly recovered if the proximities
for the largest distances are missing.  These studies are based on
simulations with many points, reasonable error in data, known
dimensionality etc, which are often difficult to assess in practice.


Thoughts

Asking subjects for metrical datass but treating it as ordinal seems
wrong headed.  Difficult to make metrical judgements -- a memory task
(cf christophe).

Could known universal timbre dimensions such as brightness/spectral
centroid be held constant when varying source parameters?

@phdthesis{Aucouturier06,
    abstract = {The majority of systems extracting high-level music descriptions from audio signals rely on a common, implicit model of the global sound or polyphonic timbre of a musical signal. This model represents the timbre of a texture as the long-term distribution of its local spectral features. The underlying assumption is rarely made explicit: the perception of the timbre of a texture is assumed to result from the most statistically significant feature windows. This thesis questions the validity of this assumption. To do so, we construct an explicit measure of the timbre similarity between polyphonic music textures, and variants thereof inspired by previous work in Music Information Retrieval. We show that the precision of such measures is bounded, and that the remaining error rate is not incidental. Notably, this class of algorithms tends to create false positives - which we call hubs - which are mostly always the same songs regardless of the query. Their study shows that the perceptual saliency of feature observations is not necessarily correlated with their statistical significance with respect to the global distribution. In other words, music listeners routinely "hear" things that are not statistically significant in musical signals, but rather are the result of high-level cognitive reasoning, which depends on cultural expectations, a priori knowledge, and context. Much of the music we hear as being "piano music" is really music that we expect to be piano music. Such statistical/perceptual paradoxes are instrumental in the observed discrepancy between human perception of timbre and the models studied here.},

    comment = {Here imagery is cross-modal, including touch, smell and sound as well as vision.

Ongoing debate about structure and function of imagery in human cognition.  Some suggest images exist in depictive/analog forms, others as structural descriptions.

The depictive argument can be further divided into representation as visual or spatial.  Visual - modality specific, literal encoding preseving properties such as shape and relative size.  Spatial - abstract and amodal, layout of objects within a scene preseving spatial/topological properties.  Farah et all (1998) argue for both -- visual and spatial subsystems exist independently.  Spatial  preserves where, visual preserves what (kosslyn 1987).

"The thesis of this paper, and a basis for revisiting the imagery debate, is that some of the processes involved in imagery are facilitated by a depictive knowledge representation scheme that incorporates inferencing techniques based on direct inspection and transformation of the representation."

"Palvio's "dual-code theory" ... postulates two interconnected memory systems, verbal and imaginal"

Philip Johnson-Laird proposes three-level representation in imagery: propositional, descriptive (2) mental model with structural (spatial) layout (3) visual image, corresponding to perceptual, viwer-centered representation.  Seems compatible with conceptual space, indeed G\"{a}rdenfors acknowledges it as related.

Glasgow's own three-level model is optimised for computational imagery.
a) image is stored in long-term memory as hierachical, descriptive representation
b) spatial representation of an image as a multidimensional, symbolic array preserving spatial and topological properties such as A is to the left of/inside of B.  
c) visual representation depicts the space occupied by an image as an occupancy array.

    abstract = {Prior to the twentieth century, theories of knowledge were inherently perceptual. Since then, developments in logic, statistics, and programming languages have inspired amodal theories that rest on principles fundamentally different from those underlying perception. In addition, perceptual approaches have become widely viewed as untenable because they are assumed to implement recording systems, not conceptual systems. A perceptual theory of knowledge is developed here in the context of current cognitive science and neuroscience. During perceptual experience, association areas in the brain capture bottom-up patterns of activation in sensory-motor areas. Later, in a top-down manner, association areas partially reactivate sensory-motor areas to implement perceptual symbols. The storage and reactivation of perceptual symbols operates at the level of perceptual components--not at the level of holistic perceptual experiences. Through the use of selective attention, schematic representations of perceptual components are extracted from experience and stored in memory (e.g., individual memories of green, purr, hot). As memories of the same component become organized around a common frame, they implement a simulator that produces limitless simulations of the component (e.g., simulations of purr). Not only do such simulators develop for aspects of sensory experience, they also develop for aspects of proprioception (e.g., lift, run) and introspection (e.g., compare, memory, happy, hungry). Once established, these simulators implement a basic conceptual system that represents types, supports categorization, and produces categorical inferences. These simulators further support productivity, propositions, and abstract concepts, thereby implementing a fully functional conceptual system. Productivity results from integrating simulators combinatorially and recursively to produce complex simulations. Propositions result from binding simulators to perceived individuals to represent type-token relations. Abstract concepts are grounded in complex simulations of combined physical and introspective events. Thus, a perceptual theory of knowledge can implement a fully functional conceptual system while avoiding problems associated with amodal symbol systems. Implications for cognition, neuroscience, evolution, development, and artificial intelligence are explored.},

    comment = {Presents a theory of perceptual imagery as the basis of cognition.  A
position currently unpopular, perhaps due to many false assumptions
held on the nature of perceptual imagery theories.

Perceptual symbols are not like physical pictures, mental images or
other conscious subjective experiences.  Conscious counterparts may
appear occasionally, but otherwise perceptual symbols function
unconsciously.

There are common neural systems for imagery, perception and knowledge.

A perceptual symbol contains a schematic aspect of a human perceptual
state according to filtering according to attention, not a whole
holistic representation.

=== Perceptual symbols are dynamic, not discrete ===

"... a perceptual symbol is an attractor in a connectionist network.
As the network changes over time, the attractor changes.  As the
context varies, activation of the attractor covaries."

=== Perceptual symbols are componential, not holistic ===

For example, as opposed to conscious imagery, the shape of a triangle
can be activated without activating a particular orientation for it.

=== Perceptual symbols need not represent particular individuals ===

Prototype theory? no, this is based on simulators not prototypes...

=== Perceptual symbols can be indeterminate ===

For example the perceptual symbol of a tiger need not depict a certain
number of stripes.

== Multimodal perceptual symbols ==

Symbol formation process operates in all modes -- vision, audition,
haptics, olfaction, gustation, proprioception and introspection.
However symbols become established in areas of the brain specific to
the mode.

== Simulators and simulations"

Related symbols are organized into a simulator that allows biased,
partial and sketchy simulations of a category of entities or events in
their absence.

The goal of human learning is to establish simulators.  Once a human
can simulate something to a culturally acceptable degree, they have
understood it.

A concept is equivalent to a simulator, a conceptualisation is a
particular instance of a simulated thing.  The simulator for chair can
simulate many different chairs under many different circumstances,
each comprising a different conceptualisatin of the category.

An entity only belongs to a category if its simulator can simulate it
satisfactorily.

=== Rhythm in Music ===

"Their hierarchical view of grouping structure in music shows strong parallels to theories of prosodic structure in modern linguistic theory, notably the concept of the prosodic hierarchy (selkirk 1981, nespor \& vogel 1983)".


=== Rhythm in Speech ===

---=note-separator=---
 A book promoting the comparitative approach highlighting
                  commonalities between music and languages, where these two domains share cognitive mechanisms despite having specialised representations.  Mechanisms include ability to form learned sound categories, to extract statistical regularities from rhythmic and melodic sequences, to integrate incoming elements into syntactic structures, and to extract nuanced emotional meanings from acoustic signals.

Different modes of perception for speech and sound, highlighted by remez et al (1994) with sine wave speech, do not contradict shared mechanisms for developing learned sound categories in speech and music. The learning process may be shared.  p.77

= Music Sound Systems =

"... learning a sound system leads to a mental framework of sound categories for our native language or music."

"Although pitch is the primary basis for sound categories in music (such as intervals and chords), timbre is the primary basis sound for categories of speech (e.g., vowels and consonants."

"I believe there are both physical and cognitive reasons why timbre is rarely used as the basis for organized sound constrasts in music." p.32 

- physical reason is that dramatic changes in timbre usually require some change in the way the instrument is excited or in the geometry and resonance properties of the instrument itself.

- cognitive reason is that timbral constrasts are not organised in a system of orderly perceptual distances from one another.  timbre relations are not perceived with enough uniformity to provide basis for a shared category system among composers and listeners.

counter example of tabla is given.  analogy to speech is given as the support for this timbral organisation.

There are about 12 distinct drum strokes, but more vocables because different vocables are sometimes used in different contexts.

= Linguistic Sound Systems =

Clarifies difference between phonetics and phonology; e.g syllable stresses, phonetics inclused study on acoustic differences between stressed and unstressed syllables, and phonology would include study of stress location in English, and whether there is a tendency for stressed and unstressed syllables to alternate.

== Pitch contrasts in language ==

Happiness = wide pitch range, sadness, narrow pitch range.  "This is an example of a gradient pitch contrast: Pitch range due to emotion is not produced or perceived in a discrete fashion, but varies continuously to reflect a continuously variable affective state. p.40

"over half of the world's languages are tonal, including the majority of languages in africa and southeast asia (fromkin, 1978)".

"The great majority of tone languages have only level tones, with the most common number of levels being 2, though 3 tones is not uncommon" p41


Level tone languages generally do not contrast more than 3 pitch levels -- beyond that and you tend to get contour tones too.  e.g. Ticuna has 5 level tones and 7 glides.

p.46 "... it may be possible for a lsitener to make such judgements [over a syllable's position in relative pitch space] even on isolated syllables, due to voice-quality factors that vary depending on location in the speaker's pitch range (honorof \& whalen 2005).

Discusses mapping of linguistic tone contrasts on to instruments -- african drumming and whistling.

== Timbral contrasts in Language ==

"Although pitch contrasts can be quite organized in language, as demonstrated by discrete level tone languages, there is no question that the primary dimension for organized sound contrasts in language is timbre." p50

supported by noting that all languages (with very rare exceptions) would be unintelligable without timbre contrasts but would be mostly intelligable without pitch contrasts.

"The human voice is the supreme instrument of timbral contrast." p 51

!X\'{o}\~{o} (sic) has has 28 vowels and 128 consonants, rotokas has 5 vowels and 6 consonants.


== mapping linguistic timbral contrasts onto musical sounds ==

== consonants and vowels as learned sound categories in language ==

dramatic perceptual differences shown between different cultures.  MDS of japanes and american listeners judgements showed very different perceptual space.

== Sound category-based distortions of auditory perception ==

p80 Perceptual magnet effect (PME), a prototype effect observable both in speech and auditory perception.
---=note-separator=---
== Melody ==

Defines as "an organized sequence of pitches that conveys a rich variety of information to a listener".  

Many differences between linguistic and musical melody, but some meaningful parallels exist.

Linguistic melody disambiguates spoken utterances, conveying syntactic, pragmatic and emphatic information as well as grouping patterns.

"Prosograms" - stylised f0 charts attempt to represent linguistic melody as it is perceived.

Nine relationships between linguistic and musical melody:

* Grouping structure - both modes use pitch for grouping structure.  An interesting avenue of research would be to try to find correlation between melodic grouping in a cultures spoken language and its music.
* Beat and meter - language does not appear to have a steady beat, however pitch variation does accentuate certain events in both musical and linguistic domains.  
* Melodic contour 
* Intervallic implications
* Motivic similarity
* Tonality relations
** pitch hierarchies - not in language
** Event hierarchies - possibly in language
** implied harmony - evidence from speech synthesis - "local pitch events may combine into larger structures that have their own principles of patterning"
* meta relations

---=note-separator=---
== Syntax ==

Defines syntax as "the principles governing the combination of discrete structural elements into sequences".  In music these are norms that are purposefully contravened by composers and not hard and fast rules.  But these norms govern expectation and so music is structured around them.

Discusses rich musical syntax of scale, chord and key structure and the heirarchical structure of sequences.

Outlines cognivitist and physicalist arguments for the origin of musical syntax, generally in support of the former.  

Formal differences between music and language syntax include lack of grammatical categories in language (nouns, verbs etc), differing functions of heirarchic organisation, and a higher tolerance for ambiguity in music.  Similarities include multilayered hierachic structure (morphemes, words, phrases, paragraphs, notes, chords, progressions), relationships of structure versus elaboration and the importance of context.

Neuroimaging suggest significant overlap in syntactic processing of language and music, surprising compared to evidence from amusia and aphasia in psychology.  The shared syntactic integration resource hypothesis accounts for this by putting blame for the divergence on domain-specific sound categories, with later syntactic processing being shared.},

Its chapters also offer evidence concerning elaborations of those basic schemes that come about through specialized training in music. Continuing themes from the first section -- such as the hypothesis that melodies must be treated as integral wholes and not mere collections of elements -- the second section discusses the integration of melody and rhythm. In these chapters there is an underlying concern for clarifying the relation -- central to aesthetic questions -- between physical patterns of sound energy in the world and our psychological experience of them. The chapters in the third section provide excellent examples of the new, scientific literature that attempts to objectively study early musical abilities.

    comment = {chapter by alf gabrielsson featuring review on his (i think 1973) work on MDS of rhythm

Defines musical or auditory rhythm as "a response to music or sound sequences of certain characteristics, comprising experiential as well as behavioral aspects."  Rhythm is characterised by experienced grouping (gestalt), accent and regularity within the limits of the psychological (specious) present.

Focuses on rhythm as perceived rather than as notated.

Includes a review of the author's 'about 20' experiments on the experience of musical rhythms.  Three categories of stimuli were used: recorded monophonic rhythm patterns performed by an advanced percussionist, polyphonic rhythm patterns from a drum machine and 'real dance music' taken from phonograph records.

Test: "six rhythm patterns were selected in a way that one could expect a solution in three dimensions, corresponding to meter, tempo and position of the subdivided beat.  This occurred..." - "the first dimension reflects the position fo the subdivided beat...  The second dimension represents meter.  The third dimension (height) is related to tempo.

Test: experiment with six polyphonic rhythm patterns for which the dimensionality was not self-evident.  First dimension the waltz separated from the others, so dimension reflected meter.  second dimension, waltz and foxtrot were contrasted against rhumba and beguine, having various subdivisions of the beats, interpretation was "differences in basic pattern."  Third dimension was interpreted as "perceived uniformity vs variation".  

Factor analysis was also done.

"The combined results from the many experiments indicated at least 15 dimensions int he experience of musical rhythms.  Furthermore, they easily lent themselves to a grouping into three categories, that is, dimensions related to structural aspects, motional aspects, and emotional aspects."

structural aspects
meter, position/strength of accents, type and prominence of basic pattern, different kinds of subdivisions within beats, uniformity versus variation and simplicity versus complexity.

motional aspects
tempo, overall rapidity
walking, dancing, jumping, rocking, swinging, graceful and driving forward.
"Some people may find such concepts trivial and/or diffuse, but we have, in fact, no better terminology for this kind of very "direct" experiences, which by the way are also often reflected in overt movements by the listeners."

emotional aspects
vitality/dullness, excitement/calmness, rigidity/flexibility, solemnity/playfulness.

    comment = {Application of conceptual spaces to music semantics.

Problems in traditional semantic theories:

Extensional semantics - Inability to distinguish etween extensional and intensional properties: "a chihuahua is a dog, but a tall chihuahua is not a tall dog."  
Intensional semantics - properties become very abstract things existing in possible worlds.

Theory of conceptual spaces does not have these problems.

Language is mapped to cognitive structure to provide 'acceptance criterea' for the sentences of the language, determining the meaning of the language.  The 'truth' of a sentence can only be determined afterwards via some form of connection between the cognitive structure and the external world.

Summary of conceptual spaces as later described in gardenfors (2000).

"In my view, semantics is primarily a relation between language and a aconceptual space.  This means that semantics is basically a cognitive notion.  The external world enters the picture only when the truth of the sentences is to be discussed."

Disclaims his "limited and scattered knowledge of music theory and music psychology".

Cites Gabrielsson (1981) describing multi-dimensional timbre space with metaphors sharpness/softness brightness/dullness clearness/distinctness fullness/thiness.  But concentrates on pitch and time dimensions.

Describes different scales, noting they are culturally situated, learned, and effect music perception in the listener.

Vision - outlines Marr's (1982) four levels of visual perception, highlighting the hierarchical structure given to perception.

Describes musical space with an analogous heirarchy of levels:

Identification of 
  1/ pitch dimension: pitch
     time dimension: temporal intervals
  2/ pitch: musical intervals "a slight deviation goes unnoticed because of the categorial pitch perception. A larger deviation will be identified as out of tune."  time: beat of the music
  3/ pitch: tonality, ie modulation
     time: rhythmic patterns, ie bars and other subdivisions, syncopation

"At the fourth and higher levels the interplay between the time and pitch dimensions becomes more important." ie to identify the phrases of a melody, harmonic succession, to determine whether one melow is a variation of another.

This article presents a theory of melodic expectation based on that assertion, describes two computer models of aspects of that theory, and finds strong support for that theory in comparisons of the behavior of those models with the behavior of participants in several experiments. The following summary statement of the theory is explained and illustrated in the article: Experienced listeners of tonal music expect completions in which the musical forces of gravity, magnetism, and inertia control operations on alphabets in hierarchies of embellishment whose stepwise displacements of auralized traces create simple closed {shapes.A} single-level computer program models the operation of these musical forces on a single level of musical structure. Given a melodic beginning in a certain key, the model not only produces almost the same responses as experimental participants, but it also rates them in a similar way; the computer model gives higher ratings to responses that participants sing more often. In fact, the completions generated by this model match note-for-note the entire completions sung by participants in several psychological studies as often as the completions of any one of those participants matches those of the other {participants.A} multilevel computer program models the operation of these musical forces on multiple hierarchical levels. When the multilevel model is given a melodic beginning and a hierarchical description of its embellishment structure (i.e., a Schenkerian analysis of it), the model produces responses that reflect the operation of musical forces on all the levels of that hierarchical {structure.Statistical} analyses of the results of a number of experiments test hypotheses arising from the computer models algorithm (S. Larson, 1993a) for the interaction of musical forces as well as from F. Lerdahls similar (1996) algorithm. Further statistical analysis contrasts the explanatory power of the theory of musical forces with that of E. Narmours (1990, 1992) implication-realization {model.The} striking agreement between computer-generated responses and experimental results suggests that the theory captures some important aspects of melodic expectation.

"Experienced listeners of tonal music expect completions in which the musical forces of gravity, magnetism, and inertia control operations on alphabets in hierarchies of embellishment whose stepwise displacements of auralized traces create simple closed shapes."

Gravity - tendency of an unstable note to descend
Magnetism - tendency of unstable note to more to the nearest stable pitch, a tendency that grows stronger the closer we get to a goal
Inertia - tendency of a pattern of musical motion to continue in the same fashion, where what is meant by "same" depends upon what that musical pattern is

Bravingthe risk of being accused of witchcraft, they helped change the face {ofscience."Instruments} have a life of their own," write historians of science {ThomasHankins} and Robert Silverman in this engaging study. "They do not merelyfollow theory; often they determine theory, because instruments determine whatis possible, and what is possible determines to a large extent what can bethought." The "natural magic" of inventors such as Father Francis Linus {andAthanasius} Kircher introduced their contemporaries to the notion that with theproper tools nearly any advance in science was possible. And those who cameafter them made great advances indeed, from the 18th-century Aeolian harp,from which came the belief that light could be bent to produce sound, toautomated weather stations, telestereoscopes, and early phonographs. Many ofthose inventions, Hankins and Silverman note, anticipated the technologicaladvances that mark our own time, which seems itself to be full of naturalmagic. {\_--Gregory} {McNamee\_}},

between signifier and signified has no discernible pattern. ( ” Dog” could mean cat,
and vice versa.) Marketing experts and advertisers, those who create names for new
products, think otherwise, that the sounds of words and neologisms can evoke images
which elicit an emotional impact. Different sounds can  ” feel” sharp or dull, for example;
they can give a phenomenological response. Poets, of course, realize that the sounds
words make can be used towards expressive means. While morphemes—roots,
prefixes and suffixes—have generally been considered the base level of meaning,
some studies suggest that phonemes can influence meaning on a subconscious level,
perhaps resulting from the physiology of how we produce different sounds in speech.
       In this paper and accompanying project, I am interested in the relationship
between spoken and written language and will look at examples in which meaning
plays a integral role in how speech and writing are represented. I will be looking at
cases in which the signifier and signified connect in ways Saussure would not have
expected. I am especially interested in what might be considered a synaesthetic
result: sound and vision are tightly coupled, tied together through meaning. This paper
will explore the relationships among issues of sound, writing, meaning, the machine,
the line, and the body, by considering previous explorations including invented
alphabets, phonetic writing systems, machines for automatic transcription of speech,
among others.},

Ideal alphabets
types:
  ideographic - one sign per word
  logographic - a glyph/character represents a concept
  syllabic - each sign represents a combination of consonants and a vowel
  phonetic - each sign roughly represents a phoneme of a spoken language

Roman alphabet used to write a large variety of historically unrelated languages.  Ancient greek has nearly one-to-one relation between phoneme and letter.  Adoption and adaption has led to many irregularities and complexities, for example in english.

hangul - invented in 1443, in wide use today, the official alphabet of North and South Korea.  Hangul consonants are based on the profile of the tongue.

Several attempts of rationalisation of the western alphabet have been less successful...

Takeluma is a nice phonetic alphabet introduced in the thesis.  Choice of consonants was informed by intuition and by "Gods of the Word: Archetypes in the Consonants" by Margaret Magnus.  The 14 vowel sounds were represented by a split line, the resulting shape defining where the sound is produced and how wide the mouth is.

In the first, expert programmers were directly questioned regarding the nature of their mental representations while they were engaged in a design task. This investigative technique was used with the explicit intention of eliciting introspective reports of mental imagery. In the second, users of a visual programming language responded to a questionnaire in which they were asked about cognitive processes. The resulting transcripts displayed a considerable number of common elements. These suggest that software design shares many characteristics of more concrete design disciplines.

    abstract = {Together with the sound synthesis engine, the user interface, or controller, is a basic component of any digital music synthesizer and the primary focus of this dissertation. Under the title of singing-driven interfaces, we study the design of systems, that based on the singing voice as input, can control the synthesis of musical sounds. From a number of preliminary experiments and studies, we identify the principal issues involved in voice-driven synthesis. We propose one approach for controlling a singing voice synthesizer and another one for controlling the synthesis of other musical instruments. In the former, input and output signals are of the same nature, and control to signal mappings can be direct. In the latter, mappings become more complex, depending on the phonetics of the input voice and the characteristics of the synthesized instrument sound. For this latter case, we present a study on vocal imitation of instruments showing that these voice signals consist of syllables with musical meaning. Also, we suggest linking the characteristics of voice signals to instrumental gestures, describing these signals as vocal gestures. Within the wide scope of the voice-driven synthesis topic, this dissertation studies the relationship between the human voice and the sound of musical instruments by addressing the automatic description of the voice and the mapping strategies for a meaningful control of the synthesized sounds. The contributions of the thesis include several voice analysis methods for using the voice as a control input: a) a phonetic alignment algorithm based on dynamic programming; b) a segmentation algorithm to isolate vocal gestures; c) a formant tracking algorithm; and d) a breathiness characterization algorithm. We also propose a general framework for defining the mappings from vocal gestures to the synthesizer parameters, which are configured according to the instrumental sound being synthesized. As a way to demonstrate the results obtained, two real-time prototypes are implemented. The first prototype controls the synthesis of a singing voice and the second one is a generic controller for other instrumental sounds.},

    abstract = {Research on spoken word production has been approached from two angles. In one research tradition, the analysis of spontaneous or induced speech errors led to models that can account for speech error distributions. In another tradition, the measurement of picture naming latencies led to chronometric models accounting for distributions of reaction times in word production. Both kinds of models are, however, dealing with the same underlying processes: (1) the speaker's selection of a word that is semantically and syntactically appropriate; (2) the retrieval of the word's phonological properties; (3) the rapid syllabification of the word in context; and (4) the preparation of the corresponding articulatory gestures. Models of both traditions explain these processes in terms of activation spreading through a localist, symbolic network. By and large, they share the main levels of representation: conceptual/semantic, syntactic, phonological and phonetic. They differ in various details, such as the amount of cascading and feedback in the network. These research traditions have begun to merge in recent years, leading to highly constructive experimentation. Currently, they are like two similar knives honing each other.

another in a cognitive space.  Discusses activation of chords within
this space to one another in the context of syntax.

TPS is compared with Gibson's Dependency Locality Theory.  They seem
to have syntactic integration operations in different domains.  The
authors therefore propose the "Shared syntactic integration resource
hypothesis" (SSIRH).  Testable predictions from this hypothesis are outlined.

                Rhythm is widely acknowledged to be an important feature of both speech and music, yet there is little empirical work comparing rhythmic organization in the two domains. One approach to the empirical comparison of rhythm in language and music is to break rhythm down into subcomponents and compare each component across domains. This approach reveals empirical evidence that rhythmic grouping is an area of overlap between language and music, but no empirical support for the long-held notion that language has periodic structure comparable to that of music. Focusing on the statistical patterning of event duration, new evidence suggests that the linguistic rhythm of a culture leaves an imprint on its musical rhythm. The latter finding suggests that one effective strategy for comparing rhythm in language and music is to determine if differences in linguistic rhythm between cultures are reflected in differences in musical rhythm.

divide into stress-timed and syllable-timed prosody.  These two terms

perhaps these two classifications aren't enough over what may be a

Specifically,one can ask if  ” stress-timed” and  ” syllable-timed” languages areassociated with distinctive musical rhythms. If so, then it mightmake sense to speak of stress-timed and syllable-timed music. Inconducting such studies it is important to bear in mind that in anygiven culture there may be historical musical influences which runcounter to linguistic influences. We illustrate this point with anexamination of {German/Austrian} music. German is a stress-timedlanguage but it appears that the rhythm of much {German/Austrianmusic} (especially during the Baroque and Classical eras) does notreflect this linguistic rhythm [2]. This may be due to thewell-known influence of Italian music on German music duringthese eras [3]. Some support for this idea comes from a historicalanalysis of {German/Austrian} music, which shows that this musicbecomes more  ” stress-timed” after the end of the Classical period},

The difference between spoken and transcribed vocables is not addressed -- the same experienced musicians were used both for producing the bol and the drum sound.  Perhaps they were adding paralinguistic phrasing?

Human subjects were presented visually with target words after hearing either a spoken sentence or a musical excerpt. Target words that were semantically unrelated to prime sentences elicited a larger N400 than did target words that were preceded by semantically related sentences. In addition, target words that were preceded by semantically unrelated musical primes showed a similar N400 effect, as compared to target words preceded by related musical primes. The N400 priming effect did not differ between language and music with respect to time course, strength or neural generators. Our results indicate that both music and language can prime the meaning of a word, and that music can, as language, determine physiological indices of semantic processing.},

there. To get a grip on the totality of timbre and meaning involved in the songs and performances of
one single artist, Swedish balladeer Olle Adolphson, a study was conducted along this research
design. The interplay between the inherent timbres in vowel sounds and melody were firstly studied
in the songs themselves and relationships were noted that showed signs of systematic appearance.
Perspectives from these observations were intergrated with analyzes of timbral bearings on meaning
and signification in words and musical settings of a number of songs.
Following the axis to performance, aspects of timbre were studied with aid of visual representations
of the signal as waveforms, melograms and spectograms, verifying observations and as tools for
identification and discussion. The study points further towards timbre and emotional cues in vocal
performances as signs of individual/enviroment interactions.},

    abstract = {The purpose of this project is to study the recorded flute sound and articulation of flutists in
comparison with the recorded speech of the subject's native language (L1) and other
languages they may speak [L2, L(n)]. Three hundred years of pedagogical literature
recommending shape of mouth, embouchure placement besides the use of linguistic
comparisons with four consonants, /t/, /d/, /k/, and /g/, along with every vowel have been
used in syllable combination to recommend the optimum output, that of beautiful music.
Language culture can influence subtle choices in tone production; hearing ranges of timbre,
clarity, rise and fall, cadences, and rhythm could be the basis from which players develop tone
as well as maintain repetitive precision in the execution of syllable choice(s). The performance
recordings revealed correlations between vocal and instrumental timbre using sound analysis
software. The initial alveolar stops of speech matched that of the subject's flute playing in the
spectral envelope in the power spectrum, as well as in the harmonic envelope in the
spectrogram. Implications for further research in music perception, semiotics and
ethnomusicological analysis, flute pedagogy, performance parameters of the communication
of emotions and vocal imitation are discussed.},

arises as to how various timbral judgments are made. An early step in these 'processing
stages' suggests that comparisons are made with our previous experiences of sounds. These
experiences are often given descriptive labels by which we can communicate the concept of a
timbre. It follows that a listener might be able to make qualitative assessments of a sound
when asked to judge against the perception of this set of verbal attributes.
This study looks at the effectiveness of communicating assessment judgments concerning
timbre under controlled conditions. The work presented reports on a study where a group of
musicians were asked to assess a number of musical sounds against 12 verbal attributes.
The study is based around describing and analysing sounds from a subset of pitched
European orchestral instruments.
Using statistical analysis, the collated judgements are analysed to indicate the level of
agreement that can be obtained from a collective view of each attribute. Some evidence of
agreement between assessments is shown by the use of group means and variances, along
with a preliminary discussion on a few of the reasons behind the inconsistencies.},

characteristic is described. The aim of this analysis technique is to uncover the role of timbre
as a structural element in melody. Gaining an understanding of how an abstract,
multidimensional sound phenomenon such as timbre is used in a structured manner can lead
to important insights into potential cognitive abilities; our ability to form mental
representations of abstract phenomena so that they can be conserved and, subsequently,
used in an organised or structured manner. This method of analysis comprises two main
components, a first which carries out a time-frequency analysis of the melodic signal and
processes the signal data using {DSP} techniques that model aspects of auditory processing
before calculating the timbre descriptors, and a second that represents the melody in terms of
its timbral changes rather than its absolute timbral values. A self-organising feature map is
used to reduce the timbral detail and the dimensionality of the timbral representation, and to
contrast-enhance the timbral changes. An example of the implementation of this analysis
technique is presented using an extract from a Japanese shakuhachi honkyoku melody,
chosen because of its accepted exploitation of timbre.},

@phdthesis{Laird01,
    abstract = {In this thesis the physical modelling of percussive drums was approached using
digital waveguides. The constituent components of a drum were considered individually before connecting them together to complete the model.
To model the drumskin techniques were created to incorporate smooth curved
boundaries, calculate the impedance of a {2D} waveguide mesh and include the
effect of the bearing edge. The accuracy of the curved boundary model, which
utilised 'rimguides', was demonstrated with a good reproduction of the first
seven resonant modes of a circular membrane. The impedance was used in a
kettledrum model where it correctly controlled the exchange of energy between
the drumskin and interior air. Simulations of different bearing edge sizes revealed that a blunt edge takes energy from low frequencies and redistributes
it into higher frequencies. These decay faster and so the result is a decrease in
sustain.
For the interior air it was necessary to correctly model {3D} wave propagation
and incorporate diffuse reflections, which occur at rough surfaces. Unlike {3D}
meshes used in previous studies, the new dodecahedral mesh proposed here
was found to exhibit near direction independent dispersion error. The effect
of diffusion was adequately simulated with a technique that was shown to be
controllable, enabling different types of surface to be modelled.
To complete the drum model a way of connecting different waveguide meshes
together was found and a new procedure for modelling a mallet exciter was
proposed. The interfacing method enabled a lossless interconnection between
two {2D} meshes and also {2D} and {3D} meshes. The procedure used for the mallet exciter incorporated non-linear stiffness and the mallet's contact area. Its
behaviour was shown to be almost identical to that of a real mallet.
Finally, a digital waveguide model of a kettledrum was constructed to demonstrate the techniques and the results were promising; the resonant modes were
reproduced with good accuracy and their decay was sufficient to give the impression of realism, whilst not exactly matching that found through measurement.},

Levy follows members of an MIT model railroad club--a group of brilliant budding electrical engineers and computer innovators--from the late 1950s to the mid-1980s. These eccentric characters used the term "hack" to describe a clever way of improving the electronic system that ran their massive railroad. And as they started designing clever ways to improve computer systems, "hack" moved over with them. These maverick characters were often fanatics who did not always restrict themselves to the letter of the law and who devoted themselves to what became known as "The Hacker Ethic." The book traces the history of hackers, from finagling access to clunky computer-card-punching machines to uncovering the inner secrets of what would become the Internet. This story of brilliant, eccentric, flawed, and often funny people devoted to their dream of a better world will appeal to a wide audience.} {Today, technology is cool.  Owning the most powerful computer, the latest high-tech gadget, and the whizziest web site is a status symbol on a par with having a flashy car or a designer suit.  And a media obsessed with the digital explosion has reappropriated the term "computer nerd" so that it's practically synonymous with "entrepreneur."  Yet, a mere fifteen years ago, wireheads hooked on tweaking endless lines of code were seen as marginal weirdos, outsiders whose world would never resonate with the mainstream.  That was before one pioneering work documented the underground computer revolution that was about to change our world forever.  With groundbreaking profiles of Bill Gates, Steve Wozniak, MIT's tech Model Railroad Club, and more, Steven Levy's <i>Hackers</i> brilliantly captures a seminal moment when the risk takers and explorers were poised to conquer twentieth-century America's last great frontier.

The symbolic approach views cognition as computation involving symbolic manipulation. Connectionism, a special case of associationism, models associations using artificial neuron networks. Peter Gardenfors offers his theory of conceptual representations as a bridge between the symbolic and connectionist approaches.<br /> <br /> Symbolic representation is particularly weak at modeling concept learning, which is paramount for understanding many cognitive phenomena. Concept learning is closely tied to the notion of similarity, which is also poorly served by the symbolic approach. Gardenfors's theory of conceptual spaces presents a framework for representing information on the conceptual level. A conceptual space is built up from geometrical structures based on a number of quality dimensions. The main applications of the theory are on the constructive side of cognitive science: as a constructive model the theory can be applied to the development of artificial systems capable of solving cognitive tasks. Gardenfors also shows how conceptual spaces can serve as an explanatory framework for a number of empirical theories, in particular those concerning concept formation, induction, and semantics.

@article{Mayo05,
    abstract = {The move to unit-selection in speech synthesis has resulted in system improvements being made at subtle sub- and suprasegmental levels. Human perceptual evaluation of such subtle improvements requires a highly sophisticated level of perceptual attention to specific acoustic characteristics or cues. However, it is not well understood what acoustic cues listeners attend to by default when asked to evaluate synthetic speech. It may, therefore, be potentially quite difficult to design an evaluation method that allows listeners to concentrate on only one dimension of the signal, while ignoring others that are perceptually more important to them. This paper describes a pilot study which aims to evaluate multidimensional scaling ({MDS}) as a possible method of determining what acoustic characteristics of synthetic speech influence listeners' judgements of the naturalness of the speech. Using distance measures (either real or perceived distances), {MDS} techniques represent stimuli as points in n-dimensional space. The space is configured so that similar stimuli are close together, while different stimuli are farther apart. Additionally, the dimensions of the space correspond to characteristics of the stimuli which influenced the perceived distances. Our results indicate that {MDS} techniques should be a useful tool in understanding the complex psychoacoustic processes that listeners undergo when evaluating synthetic speech. This method has allowed us to identify a number of cues that appear to be particularly perceptually salient to listeners evaluating synthetic speech naturalness, namely prosodic cues (in terms of duration and/or intonation) and segmental or unit level cues (in terms of appropriateness of units, or number of units).},

Research regarding this issue presents two omissions. One is the lack of a canonical model of norms that facilitates their implementation, and that allows us to describe the processes of reasoning about norms. The other refers to considering, in the model of normative multi-agent systems, the perspective of individual agents and what they might need to effectively reason about the society in which they participate. Both are the concerns of this paper, and the main objective is to present a formal normative framework for agent-based systems that facilitates their implementation.},

These structures are well suited for efficient yet accurate simulation of wave propagation in an ideal membrane. Nevertheless, real membranes exhibit a different behaviour, due to the environmental conditions and to the material they are made of. In this work we consider some aspects, crucial for the audio signal, of the physical phenomena concerning real membranes, and we will develop a {2-D} waveguide model encompassing the effects of these aspects. In order to excite the simulated membrane, we will consider a hammer model previously developed for piano strings, and here adapted to fit the hammer-membrane interaction.},

In the last 50 yearss, psychologists, anthropologists, and sociologists have increasingly studied creativity, and we now know more about creativity that at any point in history.  Explaining Creativity considers not only arts like painting and writing, but also science, stage performance, and business innovation.  Until about a decade ago, creativity researchers tended to focus on highly valued activities like fine art painting and Nobel prize winning science.  Sawyer brings this research up to date by including movies, music videos, cartoons, videogames, hypertext fiction, and computer technology.  For example, this is the first book on creativity to include studies of performance and improvisation.  Sawyer draws on the latest research findings to show the importance of collaboration and context in all of these creative activities.  Today's science of creativity is interdisciplinary; in addition to psychological studies of creativity, Explaining Creativity includes research by anthropologists on creativity in non-Western cultures, and research by sociologists about the situations, contexts, and networks of creative activity. Explaining Creativity brings these approaches together within the sociocultural approach to creativity pioneered by Howard Becker, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Howard Gardner.  The sociocultural approach moves beyond the individual to consider the social and cultural contexts of creativity, emphasizing the role of collaboration and context in the creative process.}},

* From Multisensoriality to Virtual Reality; A Mean for a Global Approach to Human Perception - "[pm is] a means for approaching perception as a global system", "PM may be an efficient means for developing new branches in the field of cognitive sciences"
* etc

criteria for evaluating pm schemes
* efficiency
* accuracy
* diversity
* specificity to sound synthesis
* plausibility
* modularity
* how intuitive/effective is the associated mental model
* how 'deep' is the modeling process
* do generation algorithms exist?
* is there a musician oriented UI?

    abstract = {Live computer music is the perfect medium for generative music systems, for non-linear compositional constructions and for interactive manipulation of sound processing. Unfortunately, much of the complexity of these real-time systems is lost on a potential audience, excepting those few connoisseurs who sneak round the back to check the laptop screen. An artist using powerful software like {SuperCollider} or {PD} cannot be readily distinguished from someone checking their e-mail whilst {DJ}-ing with {iTunes}. Without a culture of understanding of both the laptop performer and current generation graphical and text-programming languages for audio, audiences tend to respond most to often gimmicky controllers, or to the tools they have had more exposure to - the (yawn) superstar {DJs} and their decks. This article attempts to convey the exciting things that are being explored with algorithmic composition and interactive synthesis techniques in live performance. The reasons for building generative music systems and the forms of control attainable over algorithmic processes are investigated. Direct manual control is set against the use of autonomous software agents. In line with this, four techniques for software control during live performance are introduced, namely presets, previewing, autopilot, and the powerful method of live coding. Finally, audio-visual collaboration is discussed.},

@article{Mcgurk76,
    abstract = {{MOST} verbal communication occurs in contexts where the listener can see the speaker as well as hear him. However, speech perception is normally regarded as a purely auditory process. The study reported here demonstrates a previously unrecognised influence of vision upon speech perception. It stems from an observation that, on being shown a film of a young woman's talking head, in which repeated utterances of the syllable [ba] had been dubbed on to lip movements for [ga], normal adults reported hearing [da]. With the reverse dubbing process, a majority reported hearing [bagba] or [gaba]. When these subjects listened to the soundtrack from the film, without visual input, or when they watched untreated film, they reported the syllables accurately as repetitions of [ba] or [ga]. Subsequent replications confirm the reliability of these findings; they have important implications for the understanding of speech perception.},

    abstract = {This article looks at algorithmic synaesthesia, a form of sonic intermedia involving synchronous computer-mediated manipulation of sound and image. In algorithmic synaesthesia extensively shared features are created in the two media. Examples of such work by {austraLYSIS} and others are discussed. What an audience member can cognitively access in such synaesthesia is considered: creators of intermedia works may overestimate this. The fact that a machine can process image and sound in parallel, and by the same algorithm, does not establish that the human brain can. The transparency of an algorithmic process to a listener-viewer-screener is a core issue in auditory display (or `sonification'). Sonification aims to make the segmentation of a data set more accessible than it is when represented numerically or visually, and has many practical and creative applications. Current approaches in experimental cognition may assist us in evaluating these issues.},

    abstract = {The method described assumes that a word which cannot be found in a dictionary has at most one error, which might be a wrong, missing or extra letter or a single transposition. The unidentified input word is compared to the dictionary again, testing each time to see if the words match—assuming one of these errors occurred. During a test run on garbled text, correct identifications were made for over 95 percent of these error types.},

@article{Liberman85,
    abstract = {A motor theory of speech perception, initially proposed to account for results of early experiments with synthetic speech, is now extensively revised to accommodate recent findings, and to relate the assumptions of the theory to those that might be made about other perceptual modes. According to the revised theory, phonetic information is perceived in a biologically distinct system, a 'module' specialized to detect the intended gestures of the speaker that are the basis for phonetic categories. Built into the structure of this module is the unique but lawful relationship between the gestures and the acoustic patterns in which they are variously overlapped. In consequence, the module causes perception of phonetic structure without translation from preliminary auditory impressions. Thus, it is comparable to such other modules as the one that enables an animal to localize sound. Peculiar to the phonetic module are the relation between perception and production it incorporates and the fact that it must compete with other modules for the same stimulus variations.},
